## Common Concerns & Trust Questions

<div class="faq-accordion-section">

<details class="faq-accordion" id="faq-different">
  <summary class="faq-question">
    <span class="question-icon">❓</span>
    <span class="question-text">How is 3mpwrApp different from other disability apps?</span>
    <span class="accordion-arrow" aria-hidden="true">▼</span>
  </summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">

**Key Differences:**

| 3mpwrApp | Other Apps |
|----------|------------|
| 🆓 **100% free forever** | Often have paid tiers, subscriptions |
| 🔒 **You own your data** (BYOC options) | They own your data |
| 🇨🇦 **Canadian-focused** (all provinces) | Often US-focused |
| ♿ **Built BY disabled people** | Often built by corporations |
| 🔓 **Open about limitations** | Often overpromise capabilities |
| 💚 **Community-funded mission** | Profit-driven |
| 🏛️ **Advocacy-focused** | Health tracking only |

**Bottom line:** We're not trying to make money off the disability community—we're trying to empower it.

  <summary class="faq-question">
    <span class="question-icon">💰</span>
    <span class="question-text">If it's free, how do you make money? What's the catch?</span>
    <span class="accordion-arrow" aria-hidden="true">▼</span>
  </summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">

**Great question!** Here's our honest answer:

**How We're Funded (Currently):**
- 💰 Personal funds from founder
- 🤝 Community donations (optional, not required)
- 🎯 Grants for disability advocacy (applied for, not guaranteed)

**Future Funding (Being Explored):**
- 🏢 Institutional partnerships (unions, advocacy orgs) - they pay, members use free
- 💼 Optional professional tools (lawyers, case workers) - NOT required for users
- 🎓 Training/workshops for organizations - again, users always free

**What We'll NEVER Do:**
- ❌ Charge users a subscription
- ❌ Sell your data to third parties
- ❌ Show you ads
- ❌ Require payment for core features
- ❌ Create "premium" tiers

**The Catch?** There isn't one. We're a grassroots community project, not a Silicon Valley startup looking for an exit strategy. We survive on donations and founder's personal investment because we believe in this mission.

  </summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">

**We understand this concern completely. Here's how we've addressed it:**

**2. Technical Safeguards**
- Military-grade encryption (AES-256)
- Open-source security audit (coming Q1 2026)
- Third-party penetration testing
- Regular security audits

**3. Legal Commitments**
- Detailed privacy policy with no loopholes
- GDPR and Canadian privacy law compliance

    <span class="accordion-arrow" aria-hidden="true">▼</span>

  <div class="faq-answer">

**No, your data is safe!**

**If you use Default Mode:**
- Export all your data anytime (Settings → Export Data)
- Download JSON, PDF, or CSV formats
- Data remains on your device until you delete it

**If you use BYOC Modes (Hybrid or Strict):**
- Your data lives in YOUR cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

- Even if we shut down tomorrow, you keep everything

**Our Shutdown Promise:**
- ✅ 90-day advance notice before any shutdown
- ✅ Tools to export all community posts/resources
- ✅ Open-source the app code so community can continue
- ✅ Provide migration guide to alternatives

    <span class="accordion-arrow" aria-hidden="true">▼</span>

**Absolutely NOT - unless YOU choose to share it.**

**Default Privacy Protections:**
- 🔒 All data encrypted on your device
- 🔒 Only you have the decryption keys

- 🔒 No backdoors for law enforcement, employers, or insurance companies

**Community Privacy:**
- Use anonymous usernames (no real names required)
- Control what you share publicly vs. privately
- Delete your posts anytime
- Opt out of public community entirely (still use tools)

**Legal Requests:**
- We fight subpoenas for user data
- We comply only when legally required (with notice to you)
- We collect minimal data, so there's little to hand over
- BYOC modes mean we literally don't have your data to share

## Privacy & Data

### Who owns my data?

**YOU DO.** 100% of your data belongs to you, not us. We never claim ownership of your content, evidence, wellness data, or anything you create in the app.

**[Read our Data Ownership Statement →](/data-ownership/)**

### Where is my data stored?

That depends on which privacy mode you choose:

- **Default Mode:** On your device by default, optional backup to Firebase (our secure cloud)
- **Hybrid BYOC Mode:** On your device AND your chosen cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- **Strict BYOC Mode:** Only on your device and YOUR chosen cloud (we never see it)

**[Learn about privacy modes →](/privacy-controls/#choose-your-privacy-mode)**

### Can you see my data?

**In Default Mode:** Only if you enable cloud backup (and even then, it's encrypted)  
**In Hybrid Mode:** We handle your login, but never see your content  
**In Strict Mode:** No - we're completely disconnected, the app only talks to YOUR cloud

### Do you sell my data?

**ABSOLUTELY NOT.** We will never sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties. This is a core promise we will never break.

### How secure is my data?

- **Military-grade encryption** (AES-256, same as banks use)
- **Hardware-backed security** (encryption keys stored in your device's secure chip)
- **Secure connections** (all network traffic encrypted with HTTPS/TLS)
- **No backdoors** (we don't have access keys to your encrypted data)

**[Read our Privacy Policy →](/privacy/)**

### Can I delete my data?

**YES!** You have the right to delete:
- Your entire account (permanently)
- Individual pieces of data (selective deletion)
- All cloud backups (if you use them)

Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

**[Learn how to delete your data →](/delete-data)**

## BYOC Modes Explained

### What does BYOC mean?

**BYOC = Bring Your Own Cloud**

It means you can connect your own cloud storage provider (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Nextcloud, etc.) and have ALL your data stored there instead of on our servers.

### What's the difference between the three privacy modes?

| Feature | Default Mode | Hybrid BYOC ⭐ | Strict BYOC |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Login** | Easy (email, Google, Apple) | Easy (email, Google, Apple) | Custom only |
| **Your data location** | Device + optional Firebase | Device + YOUR cloud | Device + YOUR cloud |
| **What we can see** | Only what you backup | Only your login, never content | Nothing at all |
| **Setup difficulty** | 🟢 Easy | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 Advanced |
| **Best for** | Most users | Privacy + convenience | Maximum privacy |

### Which mode should I choose?

**Default Mode** - Start here if you're new and want the easiest experience

**Hybrid BYOC Mode** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED** - Best balance of easy login + full data privacy

**Strict BYOC Mode** - For maximum privacy advocates, healthcare settings, or legal work requiring complete air-gap

You can switch modes anytime in Settings → Privacy & Security.

### What cloud providers are supported?

**ANY cloud storage that supports standard protocols:**

- ✅ Google Drive
- ✅ Dropbox
- ✅ Microsoft OneDrive
- ✅ Apple iCloud
- ✅ Nextcloud
- ✅ ownCloud
- ✅ AWS S3
- ✅ Azure Storage
- ✅ Any WebDAV-compatible service
- ✅ Your own server

### Do I need technical skills for BYOC modes?

**Hybrid Mode:** No - if you can sign into Google Drive or Dropbox, you can use Hybrid Mode

**Strict Mode:** Some technical knowledge helpful (knowing what WebDAV is, how to connect to cloud storage)

**[Full BYOC setup guide →](/data-ownership/#3-user-cloud-user-control--three-privacy-modes)**

## Troubleshooting

### The app won't open / keeps crashing

**Try these steps:**

1. **Force close the app** and reopen it
2. **Restart your device**
3. **Check for updates** in the App Store / Google Play
4. **Clear app cache** (Settings → Apps → 3mpwrApp → Clear Cache)
5. **Reinstall the app** (won't lose data if you have cloud backup enabled)

Still not working? [Contact support →](/contact)

### I can't log in

**Common solutions:**

- **Check your internet connection** - Login requires internet
- **Reset your password** - Tap "Forgot Password" on login screen
- **Check email for verification link** - May be in spam folder
- **Try a different login method** (email vs. Google vs. Apple)

**[Login troubleshooting guide →](/user-guide#troubleshooting)**

### My cloud sync isn't working

**Check these settings:**

1. **Internet connection** - Cloud sync requires internet
2. **Cloud provider credentials** - May need to re-authenticate
3. **Storage space** - Your cloud may be full
4. **Privacy mode** - Confirm correct mode is selected (Hybrid or Strict BYOC)

**[Cloud sync troubleshooting →](/privacy-controls/#choose-your-privacy-mode)**

### Features are missing / not showing up

**Possible reasons:**

- **Guest Mode** - Some features require an account
- **Beta limitations** - Some features coming in future phases
- **Privacy mode** - Strict BYOC mode disables some cloud features
- **Platform differences** - Some features iOS/Android only

**[See feature availability →](/features#-closed-beta-release)**

### The app is running slowly

**Try these steps:**

1. **Close other apps** to free up memory
2. **Clear app cache** (Settings → Apps → 3mpwrApp → Clear Cache)
3. **Restart your device**
4. **Check device storage** - Low storage slows performance
5. **Update to latest version**

### Screen reader isn't working properly

**Troubleshooting:**

1. **Enable screen reader** in device settings (TalkBack/VoiceOver)
2. **Check app permissions** - May need accessibility permissions
3. **Update the app** - We continuously improve screen reader support
4. **Report specific issues** - [Contact accessibility team →](/contact)

**[Accessibility troubleshooting →](/accessibility-walkthrough)**
