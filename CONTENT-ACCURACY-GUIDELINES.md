## ⚠️ Critical Rule: No Fake User Feedback

**DO NOT** publish testimonials, quotes, or feedback claiming to be from users/beta testers until:

1. ✅ Phase 1 Closed Beta testing has actually begun
2. ✅ Real users have used the actual features
3. ✅ Written permission has been obtained from participants
4. ✅ Quotes are verified and attributed correctly

---

## Current Project Status (October 26, 2025)

### ✅ What We CAN Say:

- **"We're preparing for Phase 1 Closed Beta"**
- **"Features designed to work..."** (conceptual)
- **"We expect this will help..."** (aspirational)
- **"This is intended for..."** (planned use case)
- **"Conceptual examples show..."** (hypothetical)

### ❌ What We CANNOT Say:

- ~~"Beta testers are saying..."~~ ❌ NO BETA TESTERS YET
- ~~"Users love this feature..."~~ ❌ NO USERS YET
- ~~"Community feedback shows..."~~ ❌ NO COMMUNITY FEEDBACK YET
- ~~"Real users report..."~~ ❌ BETA HASN'T STARTED
- ~~Any specific quotes attributed to "testers"~~ ❌ NOT FACTUAL

## Required Disclaimers for Beta Features

### For Feature Spotlights (Blog Posts):

When describing features not yet tested by real users, include:

```markdown
**NOTE:** [Feature Name] is currently in development for Phase 1 Closed Beta testing. 
The examples below are conceptual use cases showing how we expect this feature to work. 
Real user testimonials will be collected during beta testing with participant permission.
```

### For Website Features:

When describing revolutionary features:

```markdown
**Coming in Phase 1 Beta:** This feature is being prepared for closed beta testing. 
Sign up to be among the first to try it and provide feedback.
```

---

## How to Write About Features Pre-Beta

### ✅ GOOD Examples:

**Instead of:**
> "Users say this is the best feature ever!" ❌

**Write:**
> "This feature is designed to help users who struggle with..." ✅

---

**Instead of:**
> "Beta testers report saving 5 spoons per day!" ❌

**Write:**
> "Our analysis suggests this could help users save energy by reducing cognitive load." ✅

---

**Instead of:**
> "Community feedback shows overwhelming support!" ❌

**Write:**
> "This addresses a common need expressed in the disability community based on spoon theory research." ✅

---

### Use Cases Are OK (With Disclaimer)

**Conceptual use cases are acceptable IF:**

1. Clearly labeled as hypothetical/conceptual
2. Include disclaimer about beta status
3. Based on research/theory (spoon theory, WCAG principles, etc.)
4. No quotes attributed to fake people

**Example:**

```markdown
## Real-World Use Cases

**NOTE:** These are conceptual examples based on accessibility research. 
We're preparing for Phase 1 Closed Beta testing where real users will 
test these features. Actual results will be documented with participant permission.

### Example: User with Fibromyalgia
Someone with fibromyalgia might use the Spoon Counter to track...
[describe hypothetical scenario]
```

---

## Testimonial Collection Process (Future)

### When We CAN Collect Testimonials:

1. **During Phase 1 Beta:**
   - After users have actually used features
   - Minimum 2 weeks of real usage
   - Through formal feedback surveys

2. **Permission Requirements:**
   - Written consent to use quote
   - Choose attribution: Name, pseudonym, or "Anonymous Beta Tester"
   - Option to review/edit before publication

3. **Verification:**
   - Screenshot/email proof of actual user
   - Verify they actually used the feature
   - No incentivized/paid reviews

### Testimonial Template (For Future Use):

```markdown
> "Actual quote from real user here" 
> — [Name/Pseudonym], Phase 1 Beta Tester, [Date]

**Context:** [Disability type, how long they've used feature, etc.]
```

## Content Audit Checklist

Before publishing ANY content, ask:

- [ ] Does this claim user feedback exists?
- [ ] Are there any quotes attributed to "beta testers"?
- [ ] Do I say "users love/say/report/feedback"?
- [ ] Are use cases clearly labeled as conceptual?
- [ ] Have I included beta status disclaimer?
- [ ] Is everything I claim actually TRUE right now?

**If you answered YES to questions 1-3, STOP and revise.**

---

## Fixing Existing Content

### Already Published Content with Fake Feedback:

1. **Remove** fake testimonials/quotes immediately
2. **Replace** with conceptual disclaimer
3. **Add note** about beta preparation status
4. **Update** "What Users Say" sections to "Design Philosophy" or "Intended Use Cases"

### Files Already Corrected (October 26, 2025):

- ✅ `2025-10-26-spoon-theory-meets-web-design.md` - Removed fake beta tester quotes
- ✅ `2025-10-28-pain-flare-mode-deep-dive.md` - Removed fake user testimonials

## Red Flags to Watch For

**Stop writing immediately if you find yourself saying:**

- "Users are saying..." (Are they? Really? Show me the data.)
- "Beta testers love..." (Do we have beta testers yet?)
- "The community reports..." (Have we surveyed the community?)
- "Real users tell us..." (Who? When? Where's the consent form?)
- "People are raving about..." (Show receipts or don't claim it.)

---

## Ethical Commitment

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Trust:** Our community has been lied to by corporations/governments. We won't do the same.
2. **Disability Ethics:** "Nothing About Us Without Us" means REAL disabled voices, not fake ones.
3. **Legal:** Fake testimonials are false advertising (even if free product).
4. **Credibility:** One fake quote destroys years of trust-building.

**Our Promise:**

> "We will NEVER fabricate user feedback. If we don't have real testimonials yet, 
> we'll say so. When we do collect feedback, we'll do it ethically with full consent. 
> Transparency first, always."

**Remember: It's better to say "we're building this for you" than to lie about who's already using it.** 💚
