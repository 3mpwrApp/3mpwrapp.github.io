# Reading Recommendations Engine

**Generated:** 2025-10-17

## Overview

The 3mpwrApp Reading Recommendations Engine uses machine learning to suggest relevant curated content based on reading history and preferences.

## How It Works

### Content-Based Filtering
- Analyzes content categories and keywords
- Recommends similar items to ones you've read
- 50% weight on category matching
- 30% weight on keyword similarity
- 20% weight on temporal proximity

### Collaborative Filtering
- Identifies users with similar reading patterns
- Recommends items popular with similar users
- Improves over time as more users read

### Cold Start Handling
- New users get trending content
- Recently published items prioritized
- After 3+ items read, personalization kicks in

## Recommendation Factors

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Category Match | 40% | Matches user's preferred categories |
| Recency | 30% | Recently published (boost for <1 day) |
| Engagement | 20% | High engagement from other readers |
| Diversity | 10% | Avoids too many similar items |

## Confidence Scores

- **90-100%:** Very confident match - highly relevant
- **75-89%:** Confident match - strongly recommended
- **60-74%:** Moderate confidence - worth checking
- **Below 60%:** Low confidence - exploratory

## Privacy

- All recommendations are generated client-side
- Reading history stored only in user's browser
- No data sent to servers without explicit consent
- Users can clear history anytime

## Implementation

The engine is implemented as a JavaScript class that can be:
- Used server-side for API recommendations
- Used client-side for personalized suggestions
- Integrated into the search interface
- Combined with reading history tracking

```javascript
const engine = new RecommendationEngine();
const suggestions = engine.getPersonalizedRecommendations(
  userId, 
  readingHistory, 
  availableItems
);
```
