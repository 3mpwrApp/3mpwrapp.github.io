      "content": "üî• Pain Flare Mode: When Everything Hurts But You Still Need Information Reading Time: 4 minutes | üîãüîã Energy Cost: Light --- The Reality of Pain Flares It's 2pm on a Tuesday. Your pain level is 8/10. Every movement hurts. Your brain is foggy from the pain. But you need to: - Check a deadline for your workers' comp claim - Find that document you saved last week - Read an important email about your case Most websites on a pain flare day: Impossible. Too much clicking, scrolling, reading, deciding. You give up. 3mpwrApp on a pain flare day: One button. Everything becomes manageable. --- What Is Pain Flare Mode? One-click transformation of the entire website into a minimal-interaction experience. What Changes: 1. Text Gets Bigger - Normal: 1rem (16px) - Pain Flare Mode: 1.5rem (24px) - Why: Easier to read without straining, less need to lean forward 2. Line Spacing Doubles - Normal: 1.5 line-height - Pain Flare Mode: 2.0 line-height - Why: Less visual crowding, easier to track lines 3. All Complexity Disappears - Toolbars: Hidden - Images: Hidden - Videos: Hidden - Animations: Stopped - Features grid: Hidden - Social links: Hidden - Complex layouts: Simplified Why: Every element you don't need is visual noise that requires processing. Pain makes processing exhausting. 4. Only Essential Content Shows - Page title and headings - Critical body text - Important links - Key information Why: You came for specific information. Everything else is a barrier. 5. Navigation Simplified - Main navigation remains (you need to get to other pages) - Breadcrumbs stay (you need to know where you are) - Everything else goes --- How to Activate It Method 1: Toolbar Button 1. Look at the top toolbar 2. Click \"üî• Pain flare mode\" 3. Instant transformation 4. Button changes to \"‚úÖ Pain mode ON\" Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut Press Alt + P anywhere on the site Method 3: Auto-Save Preference Turn it on once, it stays on across all pages and future visits (saved to localStorage) --- Real-World Use Cases Scenario 1: Checking Deadline with High Pain Situation: You have a workplace injury and a WSIB/workers' comp deadline tomorrow. Today your pain level is 9/10, but you need to check what documents are still required for submission. Without Pain Flare Mode: - Open the website - Immediately overwhelmed by images, toolbars, and feature displays - Visual processing increases pain levels - Scroll slowly through content (each movement hurts) - Struggle to locate deadline information among all the visual elements - Give up after 5 minutes, too exhausted to continue - Risk missing the deadline With Pain Flare Mode: - Open the website - Click \"üî• Pain flare mode\" (or press Alt+P) - See only: page title, essential text, and key links - Quickly locate \"Deadlines\" section without visual clutter - Read large text without eye strain - Find the needed information in 2 minutes - Complete task successfully Outcome: Access critical information despite high pain levels. --- Scenario 2: Researching Appeal Rights with Limited Mobility Situation: You're researching your appeal rights during a pain flare from repetitive strain injury. Every mouse click causes discomfort and hand pain. Without Pain Flare Mode: - Navigate through multiple menus (10+ clicks required) - Each click triggers pain response - Extensive scrolling needed (increases wrist strain) - Choose between multiple navigation options (mental fatigue) - Pain becomes too intense, abandon research With Pain Flare Mode: - Activate with keyboard: Alt+P (single keypress) - See simplified navigation structure - Minimal clicking required to find information - Larger text reduces scrolling needs - Clear, simple choices minimize decision fatigue - Complete research task despite pain Outcome: Access needed information with minimal physical strain. --- Scenario 3: Emergency Information Access Situation: After a workplace incident requiring medical attention, you need to quickly access your medical history documentation. Pain levels are high and bright medical facility lighting makes focusing difficult. Without Pain Flare Mode: - Struggle to read normal-sized text on phone screen - Regular website layout is overwhelming with multiple elements - Cannot focus through pain and environmental distractions - Need to request assistance (lose independence) With Pain Flare Mode: - Use Alt+P keyboard shortcut for instant activation - Large, clear text improves readability - Simplified layout reduces cognitive load - Navigate efficiently despite pain and distractions - Locate medical documentation independently Outcome: Maintain control over personal information during a crisis situation. --- The Technical Design What We Considered 1. Pain and Cognitive Load Are Linked When you're in pain, cognitive resources are depleted. Your brain is using energy to process pain signals. Complex layouts become exponentially harder. Solution: Remove all non-essential cognitive load. 2. Every Click Matters For RSI, arthritis, fibromyalgia, nerve pain‚Äîclicks HURT. Solution: Minimize required interactions. What's left is essential only. 3. Visual Processing Costs Energy Processing images, colors, animations requires mental energy you don't have. Solution: Hide all visual elements except critical text. 4. Decision Fatigue Is Real \"Should I click this? Or that? Which section do I need?\" = exhausting on pain days. Solution: Simplify all choices. Make navigation obvious. --- What's Hidden (And Why) Hidden: Accessibility Toolbar Why: If you've activated Pain Flare Mode, you don't need other accessibility options right now. They're visual clutter. Hidden: Features Grid, Social Links Why: You're not here to explore features or connect on social media during a pain flare. You're here for specific information. Hidden: Images and Videos Why: Visual processing costs energy. Text conveys information more efficiently when you're hurting. Hidden: Page Progress Bar, Spoon Counter Why: On a pain flare day, you're not tracking your energy‚Äîyou KNOW you're low. One less thing to look at. What Stays: Navigation, Breadcrumbs, Critical Links Why: You still need to find information and move between pages. We simplify, but don't eliminate. --- Accessibility Within Accessibility Pain Flare Mode is already an accessibility feature. But we made it even more accessible: ‚úÖ Keyboard Shortcut: Alt+P (no mouse needed) ‚úÖ Screen Reader Friendly: Announces \"Pain mode activated\" ‚úÖ Persists Across Pages: Turn it on once, stays on everywhere ‚úÖ Toggle On/Off: Easy to disable when you're feeling better ‚úÖ Visual Indicator: Button shows \"‚úÖ Pain mode ON\" so you know it's active --- When to Use Pain Flare Mode ‚úÖ Use It When: - Pain level is 6+ out of 10 - Every interaction hurts - Visual processing is exhausting - You need specific info but can't handle complexity - Brain fog from pain is severe - You're in a medical setting (bright lights, noise) - Post-medication drowsiness + pain ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe Don't Use When: - You're browsing casually (overwhelmed mode might be better) - You want community interaction (forums have richer layout) - You're exploring features (features grid helps discovery) Pro Tip: You can always toggle it on mid-browse if pain increases. --- Design Philosophy NOTE: Pain Flare Mode is currently in development for Phase 1 Closed Beta testing. The conceptual examples below illustrate how we expect this feature to help users once deployed. Real user testimonials will be collected during beta testing with participant permission. Why This Matters Beyond Our Site Most websites don't consider pain at all. They optimize for: - Visual appeal (painful to process) - Engagement (requires energy you don't have) - Feature discovery (overwhelming) We optimize for: - Getting information despite pain - Minimal interaction - Maximum clarity This should be industry standard. Imagine: - Government forms with Pain Flare Mode - Healthcare portals with simplified views - Banking websites that don't require 20 clicks We're proving it's possible. Others should follow. --- Try It Now Experience Pain Flare Mode: 1. Visit any page on our site 2. Click the üî• button in the top toolbar (or press Alt+P) 3. Watch the transformation 4. Notice what changes - smaller toolbar, bigger text, simplified layout 5. Try navigating - see how much easier it is Then toggle it off (click the ‚úÖ button) to see the difference. --- Future Enhancements (Phase 2-3) Coming Soon: - Pain Level Slider: Set your pain level (1-10), mode auto-adjusts - Gentle Animations: Option to re-enable SOME animations but slower, gentler - Voice Control Integration: \"Hey 3mpwr, pain mode on\" - Auto-Detect: If spoon counter shows high usage + low remaining spoons, suggest Pain Mode --- Get Involved Help us improve Pain Flare Mode: - What pain level do you typically use it at? - What else should be hidden? - What needs to stay visible? - Does the text size work for you? üìß empowrapp08162025@gmail.com --- Related Reading - 15 Groundbreaking Accessibility Features - Spoon Theory Meets Web Design - Complete User Guide --- üíö Because pain shouldn't be a barrier to information. --- Last updated: October 28, 2025",

Privacy‚Äîyou don't want to pull up sensitive docs in a browser where someone might see your screen. Scenario 2: Researching Your Rights Use the Website: - Read articles about WSIB/WCB process - Join province-specific community forum - Ask questions, get advice from peers - Bookmark resources to read later Why not app? This is exploratory research, not sensitive storage. Website's better for browsing and community interaction. Scenario 3: Writing an Appeal Letter Use the App: - Open Letter Wizard - Generate professional appeal letter - Save draft locally (encrypted) - Edit over multiple sessions offline - Send when ready Why not website? The app saves drafts securely on your device. Website only shows templates you'd have to copy/paste elsewhere.

      "content": "ü•Ñ Spoon Theory Meets Web Design: Energy Tracking While You Browse Reading Time: 5 minutes | üîãüîã Energy Cost: Light --- What if websites told you how much energy they'd cost? If you live with chronic illness, disability, or injury, you know the drill: You wake up with a limited number of \"spoons\" (units of energy) for the day. Every activity costs spoons. And once they're gone, they're gone. But here's what no one talks about: Browsing the internet costs spoons too. - Reading complex text? Spoons. - Navigating cluttered layouts? Spoons. - Making decisions about what to click? Spoons. - Processing overwhelming information? LOTS of spoons. The Problem Most websites have no idea they're draining your energy. They pile on information, complex navigation, auto-playing videos, pop-ups, and flashing banners without considering: \"Can someone with limited energy actually use this?\" You might start browsing with 5 spoons left for the day. After 10 minutes on a typical website, you're down to 2 spoons and still haven't found what you need. --- Our Solution: The World's First Spoon Counter We built something that's never existed before: A live counter that tracks how many spoons you're using while browsing. How It Works 1. Energy Cost Indicators (üîã) Every section of our website shows battery icons indicating energy cost: - üîã = Very Light (1 spoon) - üîãüîã = Light (2 spoons) - üîãüîãüîã = Medium (3 spoons) - üîãüîãüîãüîã = Heavy (4 spoons) Before you even start reading, you know: \"This section costs 3 spoons. Do I have that today?\" 2. Live Spoon Counter In the top toolbar, you see: ü•Ñ Energy used: 5 This number updates in real-time as you: - Scroll through content (+0.5 spoons every 10 seconds) - Click links or buttons (+0.5 spoons per click) - View energy-intensive sections (+1-4 spoons based on section) 3. Reset Button At any point, click \"Reset\" to start fresh. This is especially helpful if you: - Take a break and come back with more spoons - Want to track different browsing sessions - Share a device with someone else --- Why This Is Revolutionary 1. Honors Spoon Theory Created by Christine Miserandino, spoon theory helps people explain energy limitations to others. We're the first website to operationalize it‚Äîmaking it a functional part of web design, not just a metaphor. 2. Informed Decision-Making Instead of discovering halfway through a page that you don't have the energy to finish it, you can make informed choices: ‚ùå Before: \"I'll try to read this... oh no, it's too much, I'm exhausted.\" ‚úÖ After: \"This costs 4 spoons and I only have 3. I'll save it for tomorrow.\" 3. Validates Your Experience Seeing the counter go up validates what you've always known: Yes, this IS hard work. Yes, you ARE using energy. It's not just you. 4. Promotes Self-Care When you see \"Energy used: 8\" and realize you've used more spoons than you intended, it's a clear signal: Time to rest. --- Real-World Use Cases NOTE: These are conceptual examples of how the Spoon Counter is designed to work. We're currently preparing for Phase 1 Closed Beta testing (launching soon). Real user feedback and testimonials will be collected during beta testing with participant permission. Case Study 1: Morning Browser with Limited Spoons Sarah has fibromyalgia. She wakes up with 10 spoons for the entire day. Without Spoon Counter: - Opens website, starts reading - 30 minutes later, feels exhausted - Doesn't know if she should stop or keep going - Pushes through, crashes later With Spoon Counter: - Sees homepage costs 2 spoons (üîãüîã) - Checks counter: \"I've used 3 spoons\" - Decides to read one more section (üîãüîã = 2 more spoons) - Stops at 5 spoons, saves 5 for the rest of her day - No crash, better day overall Case Study 2: Pain Flare Day Marcus has chronic back pain from a workplace injury. Today is a bad pain day‚Äîhe has maybe 5 spoons total. Without Spoon Counter: - Tries to research legal rights - Gets overwhelmed by complex pages - Gives up, feels defeated With Spoon Counter: - Sees most sections cost 3-4 spoons - Activates \"Pain Flare Mode\" (simplified view) - Sections now cost 1-2 spoons instead - Successfully finds information within his 5-spoon budget - Feels empowered, not defeated Case Study 3: Supporter/Ally Learning Jennifer's partner has chronic fatigue syndrome. She wants to understand what browsing costs them. Without Spoon Counter: - Doesn't realize why her partner avoids certain websites - Thinks \"it's just reading, how hard can it be?\" With Spoon Counter: - Browses the site herself - Sees the counter climb: 2... 4... 7... 10 spoons - Realizes: \"Wow, this DOES cost energy!\" - Gains empathy and understanding --- The Technical Innovation How We Track Energy Passive Tracking: - Scroll distance and time spent - Number of clicks/interactions - Sections viewed (via Intersection Observer) Section-Based Tracking: Each section has a data-energy attribute: When you view a section (50% visible), it adds that energy cost once. localStorage Persistence: Your spoon count persists across page loads and sessions: Come back tomorrow? Your count is still there (until you reset it). --- Customization Options Set Your Baseline (Coming Soon - Phase 2) Tell us your typical daily spoon count: - Low energy day: 5 spoons - Medium energy day: 10 spoons - Good energy day: 15 spoons The counter will show percentage used: \"3/10 spoons used (30%)\" Energy Alerts (Coming Soon - Phase 2) Set alerts: - ‚ö†Ô∏è At 50% spoons used: \"You're halfway through your energy\" - üö® At 80% spoons used: \"Consider taking a break soon\" - üõë At 100% spoons used: \"You've reached your energy limit for today\" Daily Energy Reports (Coming Soon - Phase 3) Track your patterns: - Monday average: 8 spoons - Tuesday average: 12 spoons - Best browsing time: 10am-12pm (lowest cost) - Highest cost pages: Legal documents (avg 6 spoons) --- Beyond Browsing: The Bigger Picture This isn't just about our website. We're proving a concept: Energy tracking should be standard web accessibility. Imagine if: - Government websites showed energy costs for filling out forms - Healthcare portals indicated spoon costs for appointment booking - Shopping sites let you set an energy budget: \"Show only items I can browse with 3 spoons\" We're building the prototype. Others can follow. --- Try It Yourself Right now, you can: 1. Look at the top toolbar - See your current spoon count 2. Check section headers - Note the üîã energy cost indicators 3. Browse normally - Watch the counter increase 4. Click \"Reset\" - Start fresh anytime 5. Use keyboard shortcut - Alt+S to reset quickly Track your patterns: - How many spoons does the homepage cost you? - Which sections are most energy-intensive? - What's your browsing limit before you need a break? --- The Future of Energy-Aware Web Design This is just the beginning. We envision: üåê Industry Standard Energy cost indicators as common as accessibility labels ü§ù Cross-Platform Your spoon count syncs across devices: phone, tablet, desktop üß† AI-Powered Machine learning adjusts energy costs based on your actual usage patterns ‚ôø Universal Design Not just for chronic illness‚Äîbenefits anyone managing cognitive load (students, stressed workers, new parents, etc.) üìä Advocacy Tool Show employers, doctors, family: \"This is what daily energy management looks like\" --- Join the Movement We need your feedback: - Is the energy tracking accurate for you? - What's your typical daily spoon count? - Which sections cost more/less than you expected? - What features would make this more useful?

      "content": "üöÄ World-First: 15 Groundbreaking Website Accessibility Features Date: October 25, 2025 Reading Time: 8 minutes üîãüîãüîã Energy: Medium --- TL;DR (30 seconds) We just launched 15 accessibility features that have NEVER been done on any website before: - üîã Energy cost indicators showing cognitive load per section - ü•Ñ Live spoon counter tracking your energy use - üíô 5-minute break mode with calming timer - üî• One-click pain flare mode for bad days - üß† Brain fog helper with instant summaries - üìä Progress bar showing % through page - ‚ö†Ô∏è Triggering content fade (hover to reveal) - üåô Auto-suggestions based on time of day - ...and 7 more innovations! This is unprecedented in web accessibility. No other website has done this. --- Why This Matters The Problem Most websites claim to be \"accessible\" but only meet basic WCAG standards: - ‚úÖ Screen reader compatible - ‚úÖ Keyboard navigable - ‚úÖ Color contrast compliant That's not enough. Those standards were written for permanent disabilities. They don't account for: - üî• Pain flares that make complex navigation impossible - üß† Brain fog that makes reading comprehension difficult - ü•Ñ Limited energy (spoons) for the day - üò∞ Cognitive overload from too much information - ‚ö†Ô∏è Trauma triggers from unexpected content - üåô Late-night browsing when exhausted - üó£Ô∏è Voice control fatigue from repeated commands Our Solution We built accessibility features specifically for the disability and injured worker community - the people we actually serve. Features designed by lived experience, not compliance checklists. --- The 15 Never-Before-Seen Features üíö Energy & Wellness Management 1. üîã Energy Cost Indicators What it does: Every section shows battery icons (üîãüîã = light, üîãüîãüîãüîã = heavy) indicating the cognitive and physical energy needed to read that section. Why it's revolutionary: People with chronic conditions need to budget their energy (spoons). Now they can see upfront: \"This section costs 3 spoons - do I have that today?\" Where: Visible on every major section header across the site. 2. ü•Ñ Spoon Counter Widget What it does: Live counter in the toolbar showing how many \"spoons\" (energy units) you've used while browsing. Tracks scrolling, clicking, and section views. Why it's revolutionary: First website ever to integrate spoon theory into the browsing experience. You can literally see: \"I've used 5 spoons today - should I stop?\" Where: Top toolbar, persists across pages via localStorage. 3. üíô \"I Need a Break\" Button What it does: Dims the entire screen, shows a calming message, starts a 5-minute countdown timer. Suggests breathing exercises and hydration. Why it's revolutionary: Acknowledges that rest is productive. No other website actively encourages you to take breaks. This respects chronic condition energy management. Where: Top toolbar, keyboard shortcut: Alt+B 4. üî• Pain Flare Mode What it does: One click switches the entire site to minimal interaction mode: - Larger text (1.2rem ‚Üí 1.5rem) - Increased line spacing - Hides all complex features, images, toolbars - Shows only essential text Why it's revolutionary: When you're having a bad pain day, you need information but can't handle complexity. This mode makes the site usable even through severe pain. Where: Top toolbar, keyboard shortcut: Alt+P 5. üò∞ \"I'm Overwhelmed\" Escape Route What it does: Big button that instantly switches to the simplest possible version: - No animations - No transitions - Minimal styling - Plain text and headings only - Clean, calming design Why it's revolutionary: Panic button for cognitive overload. When everything is too much, this strips away all complexity instantly. Where: Top toolbar, keyboard shortcut: Alt+O --- üß† Cognitive Support Features 6. üß† Brain Fog Helper What it does: Click the button and get a 10-word summary of the current page inserted right at the top. Example: \"3mpwrApp helps injured workers, disabilities, supporters connect, advocate, access tools. 100% free, privacy-first.\" Why it's revolutionary: Brain fog is real. Sometimes you forget what you just read. This gives instant clarity without having to re-read everything. Where: Top toolbar, inserts summary after main heading. 7. üìù \"Too Much Text?\" Button What it does: Converts the entire page to bullet points only. Hides all paragraphs, keeps only list items and headings. Why it's revolutionary: Some days you need just the facts. This respects different cognitive processing styles. Where: Top toolbar, toggles bullet-only view. 8. üìä Anxiety-Friendly Progress Bar What it does: Shows \"X% through page\" in real-time as you scroll. Visual progress bar fills up. Why it's revolutionary: Reduces anxiety about unknown page length. You always know: \"I'm 45% through - I can do this.\" Where: Below the toolbar, updates as you scroll. 9. üìö Reading Level Toggle What it does: Switch between \"Detailed\" (full information) and \"Simple\" (simplified language, shorter sentences, larger text). Why it's revolutionary: Respects different literacy levels and cognitive states. Same information, different complexity. Where: Top toolbar dropdown. 10. üìñ Safe to Pause Bookmarks What it does: Auto-saves your scroll position every 5 seconds. When you return, shows \"Resume reading\" button that smoothly scrolls back to where you left off. Why it's revolutionary: Chronic conditions require frequent breaks. This ensures you never lose your place, even across multiple days. Where: Top toolbar (appears when saved position detected). --- ‚ú® Sensory & Navigation Features 11. ‚ú® Sensory Preferences Toggle What it does: Real-time adjustments without page reload: - Reduced Motion: Disables all animations - High Contrast: Increases color contrast to maximum - Minimal: Text-only mode, removes visual complexity Why it's revolutionary: Most sites require page refresh. This is instant, and preferences persist across visits. Where: Top toolbar dropdown, saved to localStorage. 12. üó£Ô∏è Voice Fatigue Mode What it does: Automatically activates larger touch targets (min 48x48px), bigger fonts, more spacing between interactive elements. Why it's revolutionary: Voice control users get fatigued repeating commands. Larger targets = fewer retries = less energy use. Where: Can be enabled via JavaScript function or auto-detects voice input. 13. üåô Time-of-Day Optimization What it does: If you're browsing between 11pm-5am, suggests: \"It's late - switch to night mode + simplified version?\" Why it's revolutionary: Respects circadian rhythms and acknowledges that late-night browsing needs different accommodations. Where: Auto-appears once per day after 2 seconds on page. --- ‚ö†Ô∏è Trauma-Informed Features 14. ‚ö†Ô∏è Triggering Content Fade What it does: Sensitive content (discussions of workplace injuries, legal battles, etc.) is blurred with a warning: \"‚ö†Ô∏è Hover to reveal - May contain triggering content\" Why it's revolutionary: Trauma-informed design. Users choose when they're ready to view potentially triggering information. Where: Applied to specific content sections with .trigger-warning-content class. 15. üìß \"Find This Later\" Email Snapshots What it does: Every major section has an \"üìß Email this section\" button. Sends just that section to your email, not the whole page. Why it's revolutionary: Save specific information without printing or bookmarking. Perfect for when you find useful info but don't have energy to process it now. Where: Appears on section headings throughout the site. --- Technical Implementation Files & Code - JavaScript: accessibility-innovations.js (450+ lines) - CSS: style.css (600+ lines of new styling) - Integration: layouts/default.html (script included on every page) Key Technologies - localStorage - Persists all preferences across visits - Intersection Observer - Tracks section views for energy counter - CSS Custom Properties - Dynamic theme switching - Keyboard Shortcuts - Alt+B/P/O/S for quick access - ARIA Attributes - Full screen reader support throughout Browser Support - ‚úÖ All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) - ‚úÖ Mobile responsive (all features work on touch devices) - ‚úÖ Progressive enhancement (works without JavaScript, better with it) --- User Impact Before These Features - \"I want to read this but I'm too tired\" ‚Üí Bounce - \"This is too much information\" ‚Üí Overwhelmed, leave - \"I'm having a pain flare\" ‚Üí Can't navigate - \"I forgot what I just read\" ‚Üí Frustration, give up - \"This content might be triggering\" ‚Üí Anxiety, avoid After These Features - \"I can see this costs 2 spoons - I have that!\" ‚Üí Engaged reading - \"Too much? I'll hit 'overwhelmed' mode\" ‚Üí Comfortable browsing - \"Pain flare? One-click minimal mode\" ‚Üí Still accessible - \"Brain fog? I'll use the summary\" ‚Üí Clear understanding - \"Triggering content? I'll reveal when ready\" ‚Üí Feeling safe --- Community Response (What We Expect) From disabled users: > \"FINALLY. Someone gets it. This is what accessibility actually means.\" From injured workers: > \"The pain flare mode is a game-changer. I can still advocate on bad days.\" From supporters: > \"The energy indicators help me understand what my loved one is dealing with.\" From web developers: > \"This should be the new standard. How do we implement this everywhere?\" --- Why No One Has Done This Before 1. Most sites aren't built FOR the disability community They're built for everyone with accessibility as an afterthought. We're built specifically for injured workers and persons with disabilities. 2. Compliance vs. Usability Most companies aim for WCAG compliance. We aim for actual usability by the people who need it most. 3. Lived Experience Our team includes disabled people, injured workers, and allies who understand these needs viscerally. This isn't theoretical - it's personal. 4. No Corporate Constraints We're 100% community-funded, no investors, no profit motive. We can innovate freely without asking shareholders if it's \"worth it.\" --- Try It Yourself All features are live NOW on our website: 1. Visit 3mpwrapp.pages.dev 2. Look for the toolbar at the top of any page 3. Try the features: - Click \"üíô Need a break?\" for calming break mode - Toggle \"üî• Pain flare mode\" to see minimal interaction - Check the \"ü•Ñ Energy used\" counter in the toolbar - Try \"üß† Brain fog helper\" for instant summaries - Use keyboard shortcuts: Alt+B, Alt+P, Alt+O Energy cost indicators are visible on every section header (look for üîã icons). --- What's Next? Phase 2 (Coming Soon) - Custom Energy Profiles - Set your baseline spoon count, track daily usage - Rest Reminders - Pop-up notifications: \"You've been browsing 20 mins, take a 5-min break?\" - Energy Reports - Daily/weekly summaries: \"You used 15 spoons this week browsing\" - Buddy System - Share your energy state with supporters: \"I'm at 2/10 spoons today\" Phase 3 (Future) - Voice Commands - \"Hey 3mpwr, enable pain mode\" - Wearable Integration - Auto-detect fatigue via heart rate, suggest breaks - AI Summaries - More sophisticated brain fog helpers with context awareness - Collaborative Energy Tracking - Community averages: \"This section costs most users 3 spoons\" --- Open Source (Coming Soon) We're planning to open-source these accessibility features so other websites can implement them. Because this shouldn't just be for 3mpwrApp - every website serving the disability community deserves these tools. Interested in implementing on your site? - üìß Email: empowrapp08162025@gmail.com - üìù Documentation coming: Q1 2026 --- Final Thoughts This is just the beginning. For too long, \"web accessibility\" has meant \"can a screen reader read it?\" That's important, but it's not enough. True accessibility means: - ‚úÖ Can someone with chronic pain navigate it? - ‚úÖ Can someone with brain fog understand it? - ‚úÖ Can someone with limited energy browse it? - ‚úÖ Can someone who's overwhelmed still use it? - ‚úÖ Can someone who's triggered feel safe? Today, for the first time ever, the answer is YES to all of these. --- Get Involved Try the features and give feedback: - üí¨ Which feature helps you most? - üêõ Found a bug?
