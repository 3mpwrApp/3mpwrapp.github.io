      "content": "Energy Management That Actually Works Energy is precious. Here are 5 strategies that help real people. Strategy 1: Energy Coins (Budgeting Model) Assign each activity a \"cost\" in energy coins: - Morning routine: 1-2 coins - Email: 1 coin per batch - Video call: 2 coins - Shopping: 3 coins - Doctor appointment: 4 coins Daily budget: Whatever feels realistic (10-20 coins is common) The benefit: You see what you can actually do. You make conscious choices. How 3mpwrApp helps: Use the Energy Coins tool to track and plan. Strategy 2: Energy Cycles Track when you have energy across days/weeks: - Are mornings better? Afternoons? - Do you have a good day every 3 days? - Do weekends recover you? - When do medications work best? The benefit: You schedule important tasks for high-energy times. How 3mpwrApp helps: The Energy Forecast uses ML to predict your patterns. Strategy 3: Pacing, Not Pushing The temptation: Push when you have energy, crash later. Better approach: Save some energy, maintain steady pace. The 50% rule: Do only 50% of what you think you can do. Save the rest for recovery. The benefit: No crashes. Consistency. Sustainable living. Strategy 4: Batch Similar Tasks Instead of context-switching all day: - Email time: 30 minutes (all at once) - Phone calls: 30 minutes (all at once) - Writing: 2 hours (one block) - Movement: 3 x 10 minutes (spread out) The benefit: Less startup energy. Better focus. Less exhaustion. Strategy 5: Built-In Recovery Time After hard tasks, build in recovery: - After doctor: Rest - After social: Solo time - After work: No obligations - After errands: Quiet evening The benefit: You prevent crashes. You recover better. --- Your Energy Strategy Everyone's different. What works for Sarah might not work for Marcus. Start with: 1. Track your current patterns (1 week) 2. Try one strategy 3. Track the impact 4. Adjust what doesn't work 5. Build your personal system Energy Management Tools → Share Your Strategy → --- Energy management isn't about doing more. It's about doing what matters sustainably.",

      "content": "Interview Series: Voices in Disability Justice We're talking with leaders shaping disability rights, accessibility, and justice. This month: Dr. Sarah Chen. About Dr. Chen Dr. Sarah Chen is an accessibility researcher, disability justice advocate, and founder of the Tech for All Institute. Background: - PhD in Accessible Technology - 15+ years in disability advocacy - Recognized expert in inclusive design - Author of \"Disability Justice Technology\" The Interview Q: What's the biggest barrier to accessible technology? \"It's often not the technology itself. It's the mindset. Developers design for themselves, not for the full spectrum of human difference. Accessibility isn't a feature—it's a foundation. Every decision in design is an accessibility decision.\" Q: How is disability justice different from accessibility? \"Accessibility is making things work for disabled people. Disability justice is about centering disabled people's leadership and power. It's the difference between 'we'll add accessibility' and 'disabled people are leading this from the start.'\" Q: What does good accessibility look like? \"When nobody notices it's accessible. When a person using a screen reader, using voice input, using a switch control, or using mouse and keyboard all find the system equally usable. When it's so natural, nobody's thinking about it.\" Q: What's your advice for organizations building tech? \"First: Hire disabled people. Not after the fact. From day one. Second: Do real testing with real disabled people, not simulation. Third: Listen to what disabled people say and actually change things.\" Q: How do you stay hopeful? \"I see apps like 3mpwrApp. I see disabled people building tools for themselves. I see young disabled people demanding better. Hope isn't something I generate—it's something I witness every day.\" Dr. Chen's Recommendations For Disability Advocates: - Build your own tools - Don't wait for accessible versions - Lead from your lived experience - Demand better For Tech Companies: - Hire disabled people - Test with real users - Listen and adapt - Make it foundational For Organizations: - Accessibility = better for everyone - Invest upfront - Lead with disabled people - Keep iterating Connect with Dr. Chen - Website: techforall.institute - Twitter: @DrSarahChen - LinkedIn: Dr. Sarah Chen - Books: \"Disability Justice Technology\" (2023) --- Disability justice isn't the future. It's now. And disabled people are leading it.",

      "content": "Myth vs. Reality Let's clear up some common misconceptions about disability benefits. Myth #1: \"You can't work at all on disability benefits\" Reality: Most programs allow some work income. - CPP-D: Up to $7,000/year (2025) - ODSP: Various work incentives - Provincial programs: Varies by province - Many people work part-time while receiving benefits Why this matters: You're not locked out of work. You can test your capacity, earn income, and maintain benefits simultaneously. Myth #2: \"If you get disability benefits, you're automatically disabled forever\" Reality: Benefits are reviewed regularly. - If your condition improves, you report it - You can transition back to work gradually - Many programs offer return-to-work supports - You're not trapped Why this matters: Getting benefits doesn't mean you give up the possibility of future employment. Myth #3: \"Mental illness doesn't qualify for disability benefits\" Reality: Mental illness qualifies if it's severe and prolonged. - Depression, anxiety, PTSD qualify - Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder qualify - Other mental health conditions can qualify - You need medical documentation Why this matters: Don't assume you're ineligible. Apply if you meet the criteria. Myth #4: \"You have to be completely unable to work to qualify\" Reality: The test is \"severe and prolonged,\" not \"completely unable.\" - You might work part-time - You might work with heavy accommodation - You might have good days and bad days - Episodic conditions can qualify Why this matters: You don't need to be completely incapacitated. Substantially unable to work counts. Myth #5: \"Appealing a decision is hopeless\" Reality: Many appeals are successful. - About 30% of CPP-D appeals succeed - New evidence is powerful - Better presentation can change outcomes - Legal help increases success rates Why this matters: If you were denied, don't give up. Appeals work. --- Learn More - Benefits 101 → - Letter Generator → - Appeal Resources → - Community Support → --- Don't let myths stop you from getting the support you deserve.",

      "content": "Building for Every Disability At 3mpwrApp, we believe accessibility isn't a feature bolted on at the end—it's the foundation everything's built on. That's why we support all disability types with intelligent, accessible-first design. Our Commitment: Disability-Centered Design We start every design decision by asking: \"Who are we leaving out?\" Our commitment: - ✅ All disability types supported - Physical, cognitive, sensory, neurodivergent, mental health, chronic illness - ✅ AI that adapts - Machine learning personalizes to YOUR specific needs - ✅ Real accessibility testing - We test with actual people using assistive tech - ✅ Continuous improvement - Your feedback shapes what we build next - ✅ Privacy-first - Your data stays on your device Features Built for Every Disability 🦽 Physical & Mobility Disabilities - Motor Accessibility: Dwell-click support (hold to activate, no tapping needed) - Touch Targets: Large buttons (64x64pt minimum) for easier tapping - Tremor Compensation: Ignore accidental rapid taps - One-Handed Mode: Position controls for left or right hand - Voice Control: Navigate and dictate without typing - Energy Tracking: Plan activities based on your capacity 👁️ Vision & Sight Disabilities - Screen Reader Compatible: Full VoiceOver, TalkBack, JAWS, NVDA support - WCAG AAA Color Contrast: Exceeds accessibility standards - Text Scaling: 80-200% adjustable sizing - High Contrast Mode: Special modes for low vision - No Color-Only Information: Everything works in grayscale - Audio Descriptions: Where relevant 👂 Hearing & Deaf Disabilities - Captions & Transcripts: Video has captions - Visual Indicators: Notifications show visually, not just as sounds - No Audio-Only Information: Everything has a text alternative - Vibration Options: Haptic feedback where relevant 🧠 Cognitive & Learning Disabilities - Plain Language: Clear, simple explanations everywhere - Multiple Ways to Find Things: Search, browse, recommendations - Dyslexia-Friendly Tools: 5 fonts, 8 overlays, adjustable spacing - Step-by-Step Guides: Break complex processes into simple steps - Simplified Mode: Reduce choices, add progress tracking - Auto-Save: Never lose your work 🎭 Neurodivergent Support - Reduce Motion: Animations can be turned off - Consistent Layout: Predictable navigation (ADHD-friendly) - Clear Information Architecture: Know where you are - Special Interest Support: Customize your resource collections - Time Management Tools: Break tasks into steps - Routine Support: Daily planning and tracking 💭 Mental Health Support - Trauma-Informed Design: Optional features, always in control - Mood Tracking: Understand your patterns over time - Peer Support: Connect safely with others - Wellness Hub: Self-care resources available - Crisis Resources: 24/7 support links integrated - Privacy Controls: Your mental health data stays private Machine Learning That Understands Disability Our AI doesn't just serve everyone the same. It learns: - Your disability type - Customize features for your specific needs - Your energy patterns - Predict when you'll have capacity - Your communication style - Text, voice, visual, or mixed - Your accessibility tools - Screen reader? Adjust automatically - Your pain/symptom patterns - Suggest breaks when needed - Your preferences - Remember what works for you Real-World Accessibility Examples Marcus uses a screen reader (blindness): > The entire app works perfectly with JAWS. All buttons announce their purpose. Images have descriptions. Lists are properly marked up. He navigates via keyboard alone. The app says \"New email received\" instead of just playing a sound. Priya has ADHD and dyslexia: > She uses OpenDyslexic font with 3 pixels letter spacing and mint overlay (Irlen support). The app remembers these settings. She uses simplified mode to reduce choices. Auto-save means she never loses notes mid-thought. The Disability Wizard suggests time-blocking tools perfect for ADHD. David has chronic pain (physical disability): > Energy Coins help him plan realistic days. Voice input means he doesn't have to type when his hands hurt. Large buttons are easier to tap. The app predicts his pain patterns and suggests rest times. Sierra is Deaf: > All videos have captions. Notifications show as visual alerts. She communicates in the community using text. The app never requires voice. Technical Standards We Meet - ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Level AA) - ✅ ADA Compliance (Americans with Disabilities Act) - ✅ Section 508 (US federal accessibility standard) - ✅ AODA Compliance (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act) - ✅ Canadian Accessibility Standards (CAP - in development) What \"Accessible-First\" Really Means Traditional approach: Build it, then add accessibility Our approach: Accessibility is the foundation This means: 1. Design for disability first - Not as an afterthought 2. Test with real users - People actually using assistive tech 3. Iterate based on feedback - Continuous improvement 4. Privacy as default - Not opt-in 5. Redundant communication - Text + visual + audio when relevant Accessibility Settings - Your Control Open Accessibility Settings → Customize: - Font size, family, spacing - Color contrast and overlays - Motion and animation - Sound and vibration - Language and reading aids - Input methods (touch, voice, keyboard) - Simplification levels Get Support - Accessibility Walkthrough → - Step-by-step setup - Accessibility FAQ → - Common questions - Video Tutorials → - See features in action - Contact Support → - Reach out directly --- Disability inclusion isn't a feature. It's who we are. Every disabled person deserves tools built for them. Try 3mpwrApp →",

      "content": "Let AI Learn Your Needs The Disability Wizard is like a smart personal assistant that learns your disability, energy patterns, and preferences—then recommends the perfect tool at the right time. What is the Disability Wizard? Every time you open 3mpwrApp, you'll see three personalized recommendations: - 🎯 Today's Feature - Highest priority for you right now - ⭐ Energy-Matched Tool - What you can actually do today (not just tomorrow) - 💡 Hidden Gem - A feature you might not have discovered yet Each includes: - Simple explanation of what it does - How much energy it takes (🟢 Low / 🟠 Medium / 🔴 High) - Time estimate (usually 2-15 minutes) - Why it's recommended for YOU Step 1: Set Up Your Profile Takes 3 minutes: 1. Open 3mpwrApp → Settings → Disability Wizard 2. Select your disability type (or multiple if relevant) - Physical disabilities - Neurodivergent (ADHD, autism, etc.) - Cognitive/learning disabilities - Mental health conditions - Chronic illness - Sensory disabilities 3. Choose your energy patterns - Morning person, evening person, or variable? - Generally high energy, low energy, or fluctuating? 4. Select accessibility needs - Screen reader, high contrast, large text, etc. 5. Tap Save That's it! Your wizard is now personalized. Step 2: Let It Learn Your Patterns The wizard gets smarter the more you use it. After a few days: - It learns when YOU typically open the app - It sees which tools you actually use - It notices what types of tasks you complete - It tracks your energy patterns over time After 1 week: Recommendations become much more accurate After 1 month: Wizard knows you better than you know yourself Step 3: Follow the Recommendations Try the suggestions it offers. You don't have to use them, but: - ✅ If it helps: Tell the app \"That was perfect\" → recommendations improve - ✅ If it's not for you: Just skip it → Wizard learns what you don't need - ✅ If you're not sure: Read the description → You might discover something useful Real Example Meet Jamie: - Autism + chronic pain + ADHD - Mornings are rough, productive from 2-5 PM - Uses a screen reader - Struggles with decision fatigue What the Wizard recommends: > Tuesday Morning (11 AM) > > 🟢 Low Energy, 3 minutes > > \"Mood Reflection - You usually track mood in the morning. Take 60 seconds?\" > > Why: You've been consistent with daily reflections > What's next: Suggesting peer support after this > Tuesday Afternoon (2 PM) > > 🟡 Medium Energy, 8 minutes > > \"AI Translator - Someone shared a confusing benefits letter with you\" > > Why: Your peak energy time + you've used this tool 4 times before > What's next: Can save to your Evidence Locker > Tuesday Evening (4:30 PM) > > 🟡 Medium Energy, 10 minutes > > \"Disability Wizard Profile Check - Updating your patterns\" > > Why: It's learning your real preferences based on what you actually use > What's next: Tomorrow's recommendations will be even better Tips for Getting the Most Out of It ✅ Open the app regularly - More usage = better learning ✅ Try recommended tools - Even if unsure, you might love it ✅ Give feedback - \"That helped\" / \"Not for me\" improves recommendations ✅ Update your profile - If your energy changes, tell the wizard ✅ Check different times - You might get different recommendations at different times What If Recommendations Aren't Working? The wizard learns from what you do, not just what you click. If recommendations miss the mark: 1. Update your profile - Go to Settings, refresh your preferences 2. Tell the wizard directly - \"I prefer...\" feedback helps 3. Reset and restart - Sometimes a fresh start helps 4. Try advanced setup - More detailed profile = better predictions Privacy & Your Data - ✅ All learning happens on YOUR device - ✅ Your preferences never leave your phone - ✅ No cloud processing of personal patterns - ✅ Delete anytime with one click - ✅ Complete control over your data Getting Started Right Now Open the Disability Wizard → Start the 5-minute setup → Read full documentation → --- Your disability is unique. So should your tools. The Disability Wizard finds exactly what you need.",

      "content": "Common Questions About Disability Benefits We get these questions frequently. Here are clear, straightforward answers. About Application Q: How long does a CPP-D application take? A: Typically 4-6 months from application to decision. Appeals can take 12-18 months depending on the level. Q: Do I need a lawyer for my appeal? A: No, but legal aid is available. Many people represent themselves successfully with good preparation. Q: What if my doctor won't fill out forms? A: You can get a different doctor, request a written explanation, or use the appeal process to challenge their position. About Eligibility Q: Can I work part-time on disability benefits? A: Depends on the program. CPP-D allows up to $7,000/year (2025). ODSP has work incentives. Check your program. Q: If I'm on workers' comp, can I also get CPP-D? A: Yes, but they coordinate benefits. You can't double-receive. Consult with both programs about how they interact. Q: Does mental illness qualify? A: Yes, if it meets the \"severe and prolonged\" test. You need medical documentation showing it's ongoing and limiting. About Money Q: Why did my benefit amount change? A: Benefits adjust for inflation annually. Income affects ODSP and provincial programs. Report changes to your program. Q: Can I save money without losing benefits? A: Depends on the program. ODSP has asset limits; CPP-D has no asset limits. Plan carefully. Q: What happens if I overpaid? A: You may need to repay. Work with your program office on a repayment plan. About Responsibilities Q: Do I need to report medical changes? A: Yes. Most programs require regular updates. Failure to report can result in overpayment or benefit loss. Q: What if my condition improves? A: Report it. You might maintain benefits if you're still unable to work. Honesty is essential.

The Pipeline 🌍 Step 1: Collection (6 AM UTC) - 26 Canadian RSS feeds monitored - Sources include: - Government agencies - Disability organizations - Workers compensation boards - News outlets - Policy organizations - Collects 100-150 items daily Why these sources? \"We focus on Canadian content from trusted sources,\" explains our curation team. \"Government feeds, disability organizations, and workers comp boards—the places real information lives.\" 🤖 Step 2: Automated Analysis (6-7 AM UTC) Each item gets scored on: - Relevance (1-18 points) - Keyword matches (disability, workers comp, policy, etc.) - Disability angle presence - Advocacy connection - Recency (weights) - Today: +100% - Yesterday: +50% - This week: +25% - Older: Standard - Source Quality (multipliers) - Government sources: ×1.3 - Major disability orgs: ×1.2 - News outlets: ×1.0 - Community sources: ×0.8 📋 Step 3: Deduplication - Levenshtein distance algorithm - 85% similarity threshold - Removes duplicates from multiple sources - Keeps one version, removes repeats ✅ Step 4: Selection (7-8 AM UTC) - Top 25 items by score selected - Minimum score threshold: 1.5 - Maximum items: 25 - Posts to blog 📱 Step 5: Distribution (8 AM UTC) - Blog post published - JSON API updated - Social media posts generated - Community notified The Numbers Daily Metrics (avg): - Items collected: 127 - Items analyzed: 127 - Items selected: 25 - Selection rate: 19.7% - Processing time: <5 seconds Why so selective? \"We'd rather deliver 25 really relevant items than 100 mediocre ones,\" our team explains. \"Quality over quantity helps busy people stay informed without overload.\" The Technology Stack: - Node.js (no external API dependencies) - Built-in HTTPS (no npm packages) - HTML entity decoding (handles special characters) - CDATA parsing (WordPress feeds) - Levenshtein distance (deduplication) Why? \"We wanted zero dependencies, complete privacy, and fast performance,\" explains our dev team. \"Everything runs on your device. No cloud processing. No tracking.\" Human Touch \"The algorithm does the heavy lifting,\" says curator Maria, \"but we also review manually. Sometimes context matters more than keywords. If something feels important to our community, we include it.\" What Gets Filtered ❌ Spam and advertisements ❌ Duplicate/near-duplicate items ❌ Low-relevance items ❌ Outdated information ❌ Content below quality threshold ✅ Policy changes affecting disabled people ✅ Workers compensation updates ✅ Accessibility improvements ✅ Disability rights news ✅ Community announcements Feedback \"We get lots of feedback: 'I wish you covered this,' or 'This article wasn't relevant.' We listen,\" Maria says. \"Future versions will have user-selected keywords and personalized alerts.\" The Goal \"We're trying to solve information overload while avoiding filter bubbles,\" explains the team. \"Disability news is scattered. We bring it together. We make it manageable. We make it relevant.\" --- Your Input What should we cover more? Less? Better? Give Us Feedback → --- Behind every curated list is care.

      "content": "Know Your Energy Before You Need It Managing a disability often means managing limited energy. Phase 6 of 3mpwrApp introduces AI-powered energy forecasting that learns your patterns and predicts your best times. What's Energy Forecasting? Think of your energy like a battery. Some days you wake up charged. Other days you're running on fumes. 3mpwrApp learns YOUR pattern and predicts: - ⚡ When you'll have the most energy (best for big tasks) - 🔋 When you'll have the least energy (time to rest) - 📊 24-hour energy predictions (plan your entire day) - 🎯 Optimal times for activities (when you're strongest) How Machine Learning Helps The app analyzes your patterns across: - Your activity history - When you use which tools - Your mood and wellness tracking - Your sleep and rest patterns - Your symptom fluctuations Then it uses AI algorithms to predict: \"Based on your patterns, you'll have peak energy at 2 PM tomorrow.\" Smart Notifications That Actually Work Instead of bothering you randomly, smart notifications: ✅ Schedule for YOUR peak times - Messages arrive when you have energy to read and act ✅ Learn what works - App tests different times to find your optimal window ✅ Respect your capacity - Fewer notifications during low-energy periods ✅ Adapt over time - Gets smarter as it learns more about you Weekly Wellness Reports Every week, you get a comprehensive summary: - 📈 Energy trends (are you improving or declining?) - 😊 Mood patterns (what affects your mental health?) - 🛠️ Tool usage insights (what helps most?) - 🏆 Achievements (celebrate your wins!) - ⭐ Wellness score (overall wellbeing snapshot) Real-World Example > Maria uses a wheelchair and experiences pain that's worse in mornings. > > Old way: Tried to schedule important calls at 9 AM, but was always too sore. > > With 3mpwrApp: Energy forecast says her peak times are 2-4 PM. She now schedules calls then and gets way more done. Notifications about benefits appointments come at 1 PM when she has time to read and respond. > > Result: More accomplishments, less frustration, better energy management. Privacy First All energy prediction happens on your device: - Your data never leaves your phone - No cloud processing of personal patterns - You control what you share - Delete anytime, no questions asked Getting Started with Energy Forecasting 1. Enable in Settings → Wellness → Energy Forecasting 2. Start with the Energy Coins tool (tracks your daily capacity) 3. Use mood tracking for a few days 4. Watch as the app learns your patterns 5. See 24-hour predictions appear on your dashboard Learn More Open Energy Forecasting Feature → View Wellness Dashboard → Read the Complete User Guide → --- 3mpwrApp learns how you work—so the app adapts to your life, not the other way around.",

      "content": "Real Stories, Real Impact Meet Sarah, a 34-year-old with rheumatoid arthritis who used 3mpwrApp to successfully negotiate a workplace accommodation. The Challenge Sarah worked in an office job she loved, but her RA made sitting all day painful. She'd tried asking informally, but her employer kept saying \"it's not possible.\" \"I knew I had rights,\" Sarah says, \"but I didn't know how to communicate them professionally.\" The 3mpwrApp Solution Step 1: Learned her rights Sarah used 3mpwrApp's Policy Simplifier to understand Ontario's accommodation requirements. \"I learned employers HAVE to accommodate,\" she explains. Step 2: Generated a professional letter Using the Master Letter Generator, Sarah created a formal accommodation request letter in 10 minutes. \"It looked professional. It sounded like it came from a lawyer—but I wrote it myself.\" Step 3: Documented everything She saved the letter and her employer's response in the Evidence Locker. \"If this escalates, I have proof of everything.\" Step 4: Got her accommodation Within 2 weeks, Sarah's employer approved a work-from-home arrangement 3 days per week. \"I think the professional letter made the difference.\" The Impact \"I didn't have to hire a lawyer. I didn't have to file a complaint. I just needed to communicate clearly and professionally. 3mpwrApp gave me the tools.\" Today, Sarah works productively from home most of the time, pain levels are down 60%, and she's still employed at the same job. \"Other people in my situation have the same right to accommodation. They just need to know how to ask. That's what 3mpwrApp does.\" --- Your Story Could Be Next Do you have a success story? Share how you used 3mpwrApp to advocate for yourself.

Respect the time gate (Toronto 13:00) on schedule; manual dispatch still checks current hour. 2. Use the injected env variables to adjust curator behavior. 3. Skip Mastodon post gracefully if secrets absent. 🧪 Debug Mode DEBUGCURATOR=1 logs a JSON sample of the highest scoring items before filtering. Use this to tune minScore in data/curator.json. 📂 Less Noise No more empty _curation/YYYY-MM-DD-curation.md files when nothing qualifies. --- Need further tuning (e.g., per-source boosting, language filtering, or multi-region schedules)?

      "content": "--- layout: post title: Curator gains language filtering & JSON API date: 2025-10-14 18:00:00 +0000 summary: Daily curator now outputs JSON and supports basic language filtering. --- We expanded the automated daily curator with two new capabilities: - Language filtering via a lightweight heuristic (English / French) using FILTERLANGS env (e.g. en,fr). - Public JSON feed at /curation-latest.json (enable with WRITEJSON=1) containing the scored items, source, language tag, and metadata. Why it matters: - Lets the front‑end (or external tools) render curated items without parsing Markdown. - Enables future UI toggles for language preference. Technical notes: - We intentionally used a zero‑dependency heuristic to keep Actions fast. - JSON schema: { generated, minScore, forced, filterLangs, totalRanked, items:[{title,link,description,score,source,lang}] }. - Empty days still respect FORCE_DAILY for a Markdown post but skip creating a JSON file with zero items unless forced. Coming next: - Potential richer language detection if we add a tiny model or external API (kept optional to avoid latency). - Front‑end widget to live‑load the JSON feed.
