## Energy Management That Actually Works

Energy is precious. Here are 5 strategies that help real people.

### Strategy 1: Energy Coins (Budgeting Model)

Assign each activity a "cost" in energy coins:
- Morning routine: 1-2 coins
- Email: 1 coin per batch
- Video call: 2 coins
- Shopping: 3 coins
- Doctor appointment: 4 coins

**Daily budget:** Whatever feels realistic (10-20 coins is common)

**The benefit:** You see what you can actually do. You make conscious choices.

**How 3mpwrApp helps:** Use the Energy Coins tool to track and plan.

### Strategy 2: Energy Cycles

Track when you have energy across days/weeks:
- Are mornings better? Afternoons?
- Do you have a good day every 3 days?
- Do weekends recover you?
- When do medications work best?

**The benefit:** You schedule important tasks for high-energy times.

**How 3mpwrApp helps:** The Energy Forecast uses ML to predict your patterns.

### Strategy 3: Pacing, Not Pushing

The temptation: Push when you have energy, crash later.
Better approach: Save some energy, maintain steady pace.

**The 50% rule:** Do only 50% of what you think you can do. Save the rest for recovery.

**The benefit:** No crashes. Consistency. Sustainable living.

### Strategy 4: Batch Similar Tasks

Instead of context-switching all day:
- Email time: 30 minutes (all at once)
- Phone calls: 30 minutes (all at once)
- Writing: 2 hours (one block)
- Movement: 3 x 10 minutes (spread out)

**The benefit:** Less startup energy. Better focus. Less exhaustion.

### Strategy 5: Built-In Recovery Time

After hard tasks, build in recovery:
- After doctor: Rest
- After social: Solo time
- After work: No obligations
- After errands: Quiet evening

**The benefit:** You prevent crashes. You recover better.
