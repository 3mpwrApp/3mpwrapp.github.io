## Know Your Energy Before You Need It

Managing a disability often means managing limited energy. Phase 6 of 3mpwrApp introduces AI-powered energy forecasting that learns your patterns and predicts your best times.

### What's Energy Forecasting?

Think of your energy like a battery. Some days you wake up charged. Other days you're running on fumes. 3mpwrApp learns YOUR pattern and predicts:

- ⚡ **When you'll have the most energy** (best for big tasks)
- 🔋 **When you'll have the least energy** (time to rest)
- 📊 **24-hour energy predictions** (plan your entire day)
- 🎯 **Optimal times for activities** (when you're strongest)

### How Machine Learning Helps

The app analyzes your patterns across:
- Your activity history
- When you use which tools
- Your mood and wellness tracking
- Your sleep and rest patterns
- Your symptom fluctuations

Then it uses AI algorithms to predict: **"Based on your patterns, you'll have peak energy at 2 PM tomorrow."**

### Smart Notifications That Actually Work

Instead of bothering you randomly, smart notifications:

✅ **Schedule for YOUR peak times** - Messages arrive when you have energy to read and act  
✅ **Learn what works** - App tests different times to find your optimal window  
✅ **Respect your capacity** - Fewer notifications during low-energy periods  
✅ **Adapt over time** - Gets smarter as it learns more about you  

### Weekly Wellness Reports

Every week, you get a comprehensive summary:
- 📈 Energy trends (are you improving or declining?)
- 😊 Mood patterns (what affects your mental health?)
- 🛠️ Tool usage insights (what helps most?)
- 🏆 Achievements (celebrate your wins!)
- ⭐ Wellness score (overall wellbeing snapshot)

### Real-World Example

> Maria uses a wheelchair and experiences pain that's worse in mornings.
>
> **Old way:** Tried to schedule important calls at 9 AM, but was always too sore.
>
> **With 3mpwrApp:** Energy forecast says her peak times are 2-4 PM. She now schedules calls then and gets way more done. Notifications about benefits appointments come at 1 PM when she has time to read and respond.
>
> **Result:** More accomplishments, less frustration, better energy management.
