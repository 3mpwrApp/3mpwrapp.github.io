## Interview Series: Voices in Disability Justice

We're talking with leaders shaping disability rights, accessibility, and justice. This month: Dr. Sarah Chen.

### About Dr. Chen

Dr. Sarah Chen is an accessibility researcher, disability justice advocate, and founder of the Tech for All Institute.

**Background:**
- PhD in Accessible Technology
- 15+ years in disability advocacy
- Recognized expert in inclusive design
- Author of "Disability Justice Technology"

### The Interview

**Q: What's the biggest barrier to accessible technology?**

"It's often not the technology itself. It's the mindset. Developers design for themselves, not for the full spectrum of human difference. Accessibility isn't a feature—it's a foundation. Every decision in design is an accessibility decision."

**Q: How is disability justice different from accessibility?**

"Accessibility is making things work for disabled people. Disability justice is about centering disabled people's leadership and power. It's the difference between 'we'll add accessibility' and 'disabled people are leading this from the start.'"

**Q: What does good accessibility look like?**

"When nobody notices it's accessible. When a person using a screen reader, using voice input, using a switch control, or using mouse and keyboard all find the system equally usable. When it's so natural, nobody's thinking about it."

**Q: What's your advice for organizations building tech?**

"First: Hire disabled people. Not after the fact. From day one. Second: Do real testing with real disabled people, not simulation. Third: Listen to what disabled people say and actually change things."

**Q: How do you stay hopeful?**

"I see apps like 3mpwrApp. I see disabled people building tools for themselves. I see young disabled people demanding better. Hope isn't something I generate—it's something I witness every day."

### Dr. Chen's Recommendations
