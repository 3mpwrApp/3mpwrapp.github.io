## Common Questions About Disability Benefits

We get these questions frequently. Here are clear, straightforward answers.

### About Application

**Q: How long does a CPP-D application take?**
A: Typically 4-6 months from application to decision. Appeals can take 12-18 months depending on the level.

**Q: Do I need a lawyer for my appeal?**
A: No, but legal aid is available. Many people represent themselves successfully with good preparation.

**Q: What if my doctor won't fill out forms?**
A: You can get a different doctor, request a written explanation, or use the appeal process to challenge their position.

### About Eligibility

**Q: Can I work part-time on disability benefits?**
A: Depends on the program. CPP-D allows up to $7,000/year (2025). ODSP has work incentives. Check your program.

**Q: If I'm on workers' comp, can I also get CPP-D?**
A: Yes, but they coordinate benefits. You can't double-receive. Consult with both programs about how they interact.

**Q: Does mental illness qualify?**
A: Yes, if it meets the "severe and prolonged" test. You need medical documentation showing it's ongoing and limiting.

### About Money

**Q: Why did my benefit amount change?**
A: Benefits adjust for inflation annually. Income affects ODSP and provincial programs. Report changes to your program.

**Q: Can I save money without losing benefits?**
A: Depends on the program. ODSP has asset limits; CPP-D has no asset limits. Plan carefully.

**Q: What happens if I overpaid?**
A: You may need to repay. Work with your program office on a repayment plan.

### About Responsibilities

**Q: Do I need to report medical changes?**
A: Yes. Most programs require regular updates. Failure to report can result in overpayment or benefit loss.

**Q: What if my condition improves?**
A: Report it. You might maintain benefits if you're still unable to work. Honesty is essential.
