## The Reality of Pain Flares

It's 2pm on a Tuesday. Your pain level is 8/10. Every movement hurts. Your brain is foggy from the pain. But you need to:
- Check a deadline for your workers' comp claim
- Find that document you saved last week
- Read an important email about your case

**Most websites on a pain flare day:** Impossible. Too much clicking, scrolling, reading, deciding. You give up.

**3mpwrApp on a pain flare day:** One button. Everything becomes manageable.

---

## What Is Pain Flare Mode?

**One-click transformation of the entire website into a minimal-interaction experience.**

### What Changes:

**1. Text Gets Bigger**
- Normal: 1rem (16px)
- Pain Flare Mode: 1.5rem (24px)
- **Why:** Easier to read without straining, less need to lean forward

**2. Line Spacing Doubles**
- Normal: 1.5 line-height
- Pain Flare Mode: 2.0 line-height
- **Why:** Less visual crowding, easier to track lines

**3. All Complexity Disappears**
- Toolbars: Hidden
- Images: Hidden
- Videos: Hidden
- Animations: Stopped
- Features grid: Hidden
- Social links: Hidden
- Complex layouts: Simplified

**Why:** Every element you don't need is visual noise that requires processing. Pain makes processing exhausting.

**4. Only Essential Content Shows**
- Page title and headings
- Critical body text
- Important links
- Key information

**Why:** You came for specific information. Everything else is a barrier.

**5. Navigation Simplified**
- Main navigation remains (you need to get to other pages)
- Breadcrumbs stay (you need to know where you are)
- Everything else goes

## How to Activate It

### Method 1: Toolbar Button
1. Look at the top toolbar
2. Click **"üî• Pain flare mode"**
3. Instant transformation
4. Button changes to **"‚úÖ Pain mode ON"**

### Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut
Press **Alt + P** anywhere on the site

### Method 3: Auto-Save Preference
Turn it on once, it stays on across all pages and future visits (saved to localStorage)

## Real-World Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Checking Deadline with High Pain

**Situation:** You have a workplace injury and a WSIB/workers' comp deadline tomorrow. Today your pain level is 9/10, but you need to check what documents are still required for submission.

**Without Pain Flare Mode:**
- Open the website
- Immediately overwhelmed by images, toolbars, and feature displays
- Visual processing increases pain levels
- Scroll slowly through content (each movement hurts)
- Struggle to locate deadline information among all the visual elements
- Give up after 5 minutes, too exhausted to continue
- Risk missing the deadline

**With Pain Flare Mode:**
- Open the website
- Click "üî• Pain flare mode" (or press Alt+P)
- See only: page title, essential text, and key links
- Quickly locate "Deadlines" section without visual clutter
- Read large text without eye strain
- Find the needed information in 2 minutes
- Complete task successfully

**Outcome:** Access critical information despite high pain levels.

---

### Scenario 2: Researching Appeal Rights with Limited Mobility

**Situation:** You're researching your appeal rights during a pain flare from repetitive strain injury. Every mouse click causes discomfort and hand pain.

**Without Pain Flare Mode:**
- Navigate through multiple menus (10+ clicks required)
- Each click triggers pain response
- Extensive scrolling needed (increases wrist strain)
- Choose between multiple navigation options (mental fatigue)
- Pain becomes too intense, abandon research

**With Pain Flare Mode:**
- Activate with keyboard: Alt+P (single keypress)
- See simplified navigation structure
- Minimal clicking required to find information
- Larger text reduces scrolling needs
- Clear, simple choices minimize decision fatigue
- Complete research task despite pain

**Outcome:** Access needed information with minimal physical strain.

---

### Scenario 3: Emergency Information Access

**Situation:** After a workplace incident requiring medical attention, you need to quickly access your medical history documentation. Pain levels are high and bright medical facility lighting makes focusing difficult.

**Without Pain Flare Mode:**
- Struggle to read normal-sized text on phone screen
- Regular website layout is overwhelming with multiple elements
- Cannot focus through pain and environmental distractions
- Need to request assistance (lose independence)

**With Pain Flare Mode:**
- Use Alt+P keyboard shortcut for instant activation
- Large, clear text improves readability
- Simplified layout reduces cognitive load
- Navigate efficiently despite pain and distractions
- Locate medical documentation independently

**Outcome:** Maintain control over personal information during a crisis situation.

## The Technical Design

### What We Considered

**1. Pain and Cognitive Load Are Linked**
When you're in pain, cognitive resources are depleted. Your brain is using energy to process pain signals. Complex layouts become exponentially harder.

**Solution:** Remove all non-essential cognitive load.

**2. Every Click Matters**
For RSI, arthritis, fibromyalgia, nerve pain‚Äîclicks HURT.

**Solution:** Minimize required interactions. What's left is essential only.

**3. Visual Processing Costs Energy**
Processing images, colors, animations requires mental energy you don't have.

**Solution:** Hide all visual elements except critical text.

**4. Decision Fatigue Is Real**
"Should I click this? Or that? Which section do I need?" = exhausting on pain days.

**Solution:** Simplify all choices. Make navigation obvious.

---

## What's Hidden (And Why)

### Hidden: Accessibility Toolbar
**Why:** If you've activated Pain Flare Mode, you don't need other accessibility options right now. They're visual clutter.

### Hidden: Features Grid, Social Links
**Why:** You're not here to explore features or connect on social media during a pain flare. You're here for specific information.

### Hidden: Images and Videos
**Why:** Visual processing costs energy. Text conveys information more efficiently when you're hurting.

### Hidden: Page Progress Bar, Spoon Counter
**Why:** On a pain flare day, you're not tracking your energy‚Äîyou KNOW you're low. One less thing to look at.

### What Stays: Navigation, Breadcrumbs, Critical Links
**Why:** You still need to find information and move between pages. We simplify, but don't eliminate.

---

## Accessibility Within Accessibility

Pain Flare Mode is already an accessibility feature. But we made it even more accessible:

‚úÖ **Keyboard Shortcut:** Alt+P (no mouse needed)
‚úÖ **Screen Reader Friendly:** Announces "Pain mode activated"
‚úÖ **Persists Across Pages:** Turn it on once, stays on everywhere
‚úÖ **Toggle On/Off:** Easy to disable when you're feeling better
‚úÖ **Visual Indicator:** Button shows "‚úÖ Pain mode ON" so you know it's active

---

## When to Use Pain Flare Mode

### ‚úÖ Use It When:
- Pain level is 6+ out of 10
- Every interaction hurts
- Visual processing is exhausting
- You need specific info but can't handle complexity
- Brain fog from pain is severe
- You're in a medical setting (bright lights, noise)
- Post-medication drowsiness + pain

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe Don't Use When:
- You're browsing casually (overwhelmed mode might be better)
- You want community interaction (forums have richer layout)
- You're exploring features (features grid helps discovery)

**Pro Tip:** You can always toggle it on mid-browse if pain increases.

---

## Design Philosophy

**NOTE:** Pain Flare Mode is currently in development for Phase 1 Closed Beta testing. The conceptual examples below illustrate how we expect this feature to help users once deployed. Real user testimonials will be collected during beta testing with participant permission.

### Why This Matters Beyond Our Site

Most websites don't consider pain at all. They optimize for:
- Visual appeal (painful to process)
- Engagement (requires energy you don't have)
- Feature discovery (overwhelming)

**We optimize for:**
- Getting information despite pain
- Minimal interaction
- Maximum clarity

**This should be industry standard.**

Imagine:
- Government forms with Pain Flare Mode
- Healthcare portals with simplified views
- Banking websites that don't require 20 clicks

**We're proving it's possible. Others should follow.**

---

## Try It Now

**Experience Pain Flare Mode:**

1. **Visit any page on our site**
2. **Click the üî• button** in the top toolbar (or press Alt+P)
3. **Watch the transformation**
4. **Notice what changes** - smaller toolbar, bigger text, simplified layout
5. **Try navigating** - see how much easier it is

**Then toggle it off** (click the ‚úÖ button) to see the difference.

---

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2-3)

### Coming Soon:
- **Pain Level Slider:** Set your pain level (1-10), mode auto-adjusts
- **Gentle Animations:** Option to re-enable SOME animations but slower, gentler
- **Voice Control Integration:** "Hey 3mpwr, pain mode on"
- **Auto-Detect:** If spoon counter shows high usage + low remaining spoons, suggest Pain Mode
