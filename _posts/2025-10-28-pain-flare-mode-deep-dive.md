## The Reality of Pain Flares

It's 2pm on a Tuesday. Your pain level is 8/10. Every movement hurts. Your brain is foggy from the pain. But you need to:
- Check a deadline for your workers' comp claim
- Find that document you saved last week
- Read an important email about your case

**Most websites on a pain flare day:** Impossible. Too much clicking, scrolling, reading, deciding. You give up.

**3mpwrApp on a pain flare day:** One button. Everything becomes manageable.

---

## What Is Pain Flare Mode?

**One-click transformation of the entire website into a minimal-interaction experience.**

### What Changes:

**1. Text Gets Bigger**
- Normal: 1rem (16px)
- Pain Flare Mode: 1.5rem (24px)
- **Why:** Easier to read without straining, less need to lean forward

**2. Line Spacing Doubles**
- Normal: 1.5 line-height
- Pain Flare Mode: 2.0 line-height
- **Why:** Less visual crowding, easier to track lines

**3. All Complexity Disappears**
- Toolbars: Hidden
- Images: Hidden
- Videos: Hidden
- Animations: Stopped
- Features grid: Hidden
- Social links: Hidden
- Complex layouts: Simplified

**Why:** Every element you don't need is visual noise that requires processing. Pain makes processing exhausting.

**4. Only Essential Content Shows**
- Page title and headings
- Critical body text
- Important links
- Key information

**Why:** You came for specific information. Everything else is a barrier.

**5. Navigation Simplified**
- Main navigation remains (you need to get to other pages)
- Breadcrumbs stay (you need to know where you are)
- Everything else goes

## How to Activate It

### Method 1: Toolbar Button
1. Look at the top toolbar
2. Click **"üî• Pain flare mode"**
3. Instant transformation
4. Button changes to **"‚úÖ Pain mode ON"**

### Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut
Press **Alt + P** anywhere on the site

### Method 3: Auto-Save Preference
Turn it on once, it stays on across all pages and future visits (saved to localStorage)

## Real-World Use Cases

### Case Study 1: Sarah's WSIB Deadline

**Situation:** Sarah has a workplace back injury. Today her pain is 9/10. She has a WSIB deadline tomorrow and needs to check what documents she still needs to submit.

**Without Pain Flare Mode:**
- Opens website
- Overwhelmed by images, toolbars, features grid
- Pain increases from visual processing
- Scrolls slowly (each scroll hurts)
- Struggles to find the deadline info among all the content
- Gives up after 5 minutes, too exhausted
- Misses deadline

**With Pain Flare Mode:**
- Opens website
- Clicks "üî• Pain flare mode" (or Alt+P)
- Sees only: page title, simple text, key links
- Immediately finds "Deadlines" section (no visual clutter)
- Reads big text without straining
- Finds answer in 2 minutes
- Doesn't miss deadline

**Outcome:** Pain didn't stop her from getting what she needed.

### Case Study 2: Marcus's Research Day

**Situation:** Marcus is researching his appeal rights but he's having a pain flare from his repetitive strain injury. Every click makes his hand throb.

**Without Pain Flare Mode:**
- Needs to click 10+ times to navigate
- Each click = pain spike
- Scrolls extensively (wrist pain)
- Decides between multiple options (mental load)
- Too painful, stops research

**With Pain Flare Mode:**
- Activates mode: Alt+P (one keypress)
- Sees simplified navigation
- Minimal clicking required
- Large text = less scrolling needed
- Simple choices = less decision fatigue
- Completes research despite pain

**Outcome:** Maintained agency over his case even on a bad day.

### Case Study 3: Jennifer's Emergency Access

**Situation:** Jennifer fell at work. In the ER, she needs to access her medical history stored in Evidence Locker. Her phone screen is hard to see through the pain and fluorescent lights.

**Without Pain Flare Mode:**
- Squints at normal-sized text
- Overwhelmed by regular website layout
- Can't focus through pain
- Asks nurse for help (feels helpless)

**With Pain Flare Mode:**
- Alt+P keyboard shortcut
- Giant text, simple layout
- Easy to navigate even in pain
- Finds medical history quickly
- Maintains independence

**Outcome:** Kept control of her information during a crisis.

## The Technical Design

### What We Considered

**1. Pain and Cognitive Load Are Linked**
When you're in pain, cognitive resources are depleted. Your brain is using energy to process pain signals. Complex layouts become exponentially harder.

**Solution:** Remove all non-essential cognitive load.

**2. Every Click Matters**
For RSI, arthritis, fibromyalgia, nerve pain‚Äîclicks HURT.

**Solution:** Minimize required interactions. What's left is essential only.

**3. Visual Processing Costs Energy**
Processing images, colors, animations requires mental energy you don't have.

**Solution:** Hide all visual elements except critical text.

**4. Decision Fatigue Is Real**
"Should I click this? Or that? Which section do I need?" = exhausting on pain days.

**Solution:** Simplify all choices. Make navigation obvious.

---

## What's Hidden (And Why)

### Hidden: Accessibility Toolbar
**Why:** If you've activated Pain Flare Mode, you don't need other accessibility options right now. They're visual clutter.

### Hidden: Features Grid, Social Links
**Why:** You're not here to explore features or connect on social media during a pain flare. You're here for specific information.

### Hidden: Images and Videos
**Why:** Visual processing costs energy. Text conveys information more efficiently when you're hurting.

### Hidden: Page Progress Bar, Spoon Counter
**Why:** On a pain flare day, you're not tracking your energy‚Äîyou KNOW you're low. One less thing to look at.

### What Stays: Navigation, Breadcrumbs, Critical Links
**Why:** You still need to find information and move between pages. We simplify, but don't eliminate.

---

## Accessibility Within Accessibility

Pain Flare Mode is already an accessibility feature. But we made it even more accessible:

‚úÖ **Keyboard Shortcut:** Alt+P (no mouse needed)
‚úÖ **Screen Reader Friendly:** Announces "Pain mode activated"
‚úÖ **Persists Across Pages:** Turn it on once, stays on everywhere
‚úÖ **Toggle On/Off:** Easy to disable when you're feeling better
‚úÖ **Visual Indicator:** Button shows "‚úÖ Pain mode ON" so you know it's active

---

## When to Use Pain Flare Mode

### ‚úÖ Use It When:
- Pain level is 6+ out of 10
- Every interaction hurts
- Visual processing is exhausting
- You need specific info but can't handle complexity
- Brain fog from pain is severe
- You're in a medical setting (bright lights, noise)
- Post-medication drowsiness + pain

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe Don't Use When:
- You're browsing casually (overwhelmed mode might be better)
- You want community interaction (forums have richer layout)
- You're exploring features (features grid helps discovery)

**Pro Tip:** You can always toggle it on mid-browse if pain increases.

---

## Design Philosophy

**NOTE:** Pain Flare Mode is currently in development for Phase 1 Closed Beta testing. The conceptual examples below illustrate how we expect this feature to help users once deployed. Real user testimonials will be collected during beta testing with participant permission.

### Why This Matters Beyond Our Site

Most websites don't consider pain at all. They optimize for:
- Visual appeal (painful to process)
- Engagement (requires energy you don't have)
- Feature discovery (overwhelming)

**We optimize for:**
- Getting information despite pain
- Minimal interaction
- Maximum clarity

**This should be industry standard.**

Imagine:
- Government forms with Pain Flare Mode
- Healthcare portals with simplified views
- Banking websites that don't require 20 clicks

**We're proving it's possible. Others should follow.**

---

## Try It Now

**Experience Pain Flare Mode:**

1. **Visit any page on our site**
2. **Click the üî• button** in the top toolbar (or press Alt+P)
3. **Watch the transformation**
4. **Notice what changes** - smaller toolbar, bigger text, simplified layout
5. **Try navigating** - see how much easier it is

**Then toggle it off** (click the ‚úÖ button) to see the difference.

---

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2-3)

### Coming Soon:
- **Pain Level Slider:** Set your pain level (1-10), mode auto-adjusts
- **Gentle Animations:** Option to re-enable SOME animations but slower, gentler
- **Voice Control Integration:** "Hey 3mpwr, pain mode on"
- **Auto-Detect:** If spoon counter shows high usage + low remaining spoons, suggest Pain Mode
