## Let AI Learn Your Needs

The Disability Wizard is like a smart personal assistant that learns your disability, energy patterns, and preferences—then recommends the perfect tool at the right time.

### What is the Disability Wizard?

Every time you open 3mpwrApp, you'll see three personalized recommendations:

- 🎯 **Today's Feature** - Highest priority for you right now
- ⭐ **Energy-Matched Tool** - What you can actually do today (not just tomorrow)
- 💡 **Hidden Gem** - A feature you might not have discovered yet

Each includes:
- Simple explanation of what it does
- How much energy it takes (🟢 Low / 🟠 Medium / 🔴 High)
- Time estimate (usually 2-15 minutes)
- Why it's recommended for YOU

### Step 1: Set Up Your Profile

**Takes 3 minutes:**

1. Open 3mpwrApp → Settings → Disability Wizard
2. Select your disability type (or multiple if relevant)
   - Physical disabilities
   - Neurodivergent (ADHD, autism, etc.)
   - Cognitive/learning disabilities
   - Mental health conditions
   - Chronic illness
   - Sensory disabilities
3. Choose your energy patterns
   - Morning person, evening person, or variable?
   - Generally high energy, low energy, or fluctuating?
4. Select accessibility needs
   - Screen reader, high contrast, large text, etc.
5. Tap Save

**That's it!** Your wizard is now personalized.

### Step 2: Let It Learn Your Patterns

The wizard gets smarter the more you use it. After a few days:

- It learns when YOU typically open the app
- It sees which tools you actually use
- It notices what types of tasks you complete
- It tracks your energy patterns over time

**After 1 week:** Recommendations become much more accurate  
**After 1 month:** Wizard knows you better than you know yourself

### Step 3: Follow the Recommendations

Try the suggestions it offers. You don't have to use them, but:

- ✅ **If it helps:** Tell the app "That was perfect" → recommendations improve
- ✅ **If it's not for you:** Just skip it → Wizard learns what you don't need
- ✅ **If you're not sure:** Read the description → You might discover something useful

### Real Example

**Meet Jamie:**
- Autism + chronic pain + ADHD
- Mornings are rough, productive from 2-5 PM
- Uses a screen reader
- Struggles with decision fatigue

**What the Wizard recommends:**

> **Tuesday Morning (11 AM)**
> 
> 🟢 Low Energy, 3 minutes
> 
> "Mood Reflection - You usually track mood in the morning. Take 60 seconds?"
>
> Why: You've been consistent with daily reflections
> What's next: Suggesting peer support after this

> **Tuesday Afternoon (2 PM)**
>
> 🟡 Medium Energy, 8 minutes
>
> "AI Translator - Someone shared a confusing benefits letter with you"
>
> Why: Your peak energy time + you've used this tool 4 times before
> What's next: Can save to your Evidence Locker

> **Tuesday Evening (4:30 PM)**
>
> 🟡 Medium Energy, 10 minutes
>
> "Disability Wizard Profile Check - Updating your patterns"
>
> Why: It's learning your real preferences based on what you actually use
> What's next: Tomorrow's recommendations will be even better

### Tips for Getting the Most Out of It

✅ **Open the app regularly** - More usage = better learning  
✅ **Try recommended tools** - Even if unsure, you might love it  
✅ **Give feedback** - "That helped" / "Not for me" improves recommendations  
✅ **Update your profile** - If your energy changes, tell the wizard  
✅ **Check different times** - You might get different recommendations at different times  

### What If Recommendations Aren't Working?

**The wizard learns from what you do, not just what you click.** If recommendations miss the mark:

1. **Update your profile** - Go to Settings, refresh your preferences
2. **Tell the wizard directly** - "I prefer..." feedback helps
3. **Reset and restart** - Sometimes a fresh start helps
4. **Try advanced setup** - More detailed profile = better predictions

### Privacy & Your Data

- ✅ All learning happens on YOUR device
- ✅ Your preferences never leave your phone
- ✅ No cloud processing of personal patterns
- ✅ Delete anytime with one click
- ✅ Complete control over your data
