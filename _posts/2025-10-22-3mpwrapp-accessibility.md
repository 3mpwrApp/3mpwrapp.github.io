## Building for Every Disability

At 3mpwrApp, we believe accessibility isn't a feature bolted on at the end—it's the foundation everything's built on. That's why we support **all disability types** with intelligent, accessible-first design.

### Our Commitment: Disability-Centered Design

We start every design decision by asking: **"Who are we leaving out?"**

Our commitment:
- ✅ **All disability types supported** - Physical, cognitive, sensory, neurodivergent, mental health, chronic illness

### Machine Learning That Understands Disability

Our AI doesn't just serve everyone the same. It learns:

- **Your disability type** - Customize features for your specific needs
- **Your energy patterns** - Predict when you'll have capacity
- **Your communication style** - Text, voice, visual, or mixed
- **Your accessibility tools** - Screen reader? Adjust automatically
- **Your pain/symptom patterns** - Suggest breaks when needed
- **Your preferences** - Remember what works for you

### Real-World Accessibility Examples

**Marcus uses a screen reader (blindness):**
> The entire app works perfectly with JAWS. All buttons announce their purpose. Images have descriptions. Lists are properly marked up. He navigates via keyboard alone. The app says "New email received" instead of just playing a sound.

**Priya has ADHD and dyslexia:**
> She uses OpenDyslexic font with 3 pixels letter spacing and mint overlay (Irlen support). The app remembers these settings. She uses simplified mode to reduce choices. Auto-save means she never loses notes mid-thought. The Disability Wizard suggests time-blocking tools perfect for ADHD.

**David has chronic pain (physical disability):**
> Energy Coins help him plan realistic days. Voice input means he doesn't have to type when his hands hurt. Large buttons are easier to tap. The app predicts his pain patterns and suggests rest times.

**Sierra is Deaf:**
> All videos have captions. Notifications show as visual alerts. She communicates in the community using text. The app never requires voice.

### Technical Standards We Meet

- ✅ **WCAG 2.1 AA** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Level AA)
- ✅ **ADA Compliance** (Americans with Disabilities Act)
- ✅ **Section 508** (US federal accessibility standard)
- ✅ **AODA Compliance** (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act)
- ✅ **Canadian Accessibility Standards** (CAP - in development)

### What "Accessible-First" Really Means

Traditional approach: Build it, then add accessibility  
**Our approach:** Accessibility is the foundation

This means:
1. **Design for disability first** - Not as an afterthought
2. **Test with real users** - People actually using assistive tech
3. **Iterate based on feedback** - Continuous improvement
4. **Privacy as default** - Not opt-in
5. **Redundant communication** - Text + visual + audio when relevant
