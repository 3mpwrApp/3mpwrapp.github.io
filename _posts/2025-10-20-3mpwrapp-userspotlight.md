## Real Stories, Real Impact

Meet Sarah, a 34-year-old with rheumatoid arthritis who used 3mpwrApp to successfully negotiate a workplace accommodation.

### The Challenge

Sarah worked in an office job she loved, but her RA made sitting all day painful. She'd tried asking informally, but her employer kept saying "it's not possible."

"I knew I had rights," Sarah says, "but I didn't know how to communicate them professionally."

### The 3mpwrApp Solution

**Step 1: Learned her rights**
Sarah used 3mpwrApp's Policy Simplifier to understand Ontario's accommodation requirements. "I learned employers HAVE to accommodate," she explains.

**Step 2: Generated a professional letter**
Using the Master Letter Generator, Sarah created a formal accommodation request letter in 10 minutes. "It looked professional. It sounded like it came from a lawyer—but I wrote it myself."

**Step 3: Documented everything**
She saved the letter and her employer's response in the Evidence Locker. "If this escalates, I have proof of everything."

**Step 4: Got her accommodation**
Within 2 weeks, Sarah's employer approved a work-from-home arrangement 3 days per week. "I think the professional letter made the difference."

### The Impact

"I didn't have to hire a lawyer. I didn't have to file a complaint. I just needed to communicate clearly and professionally. 3mpwrApp gave me the tools."

Today, Sarah works productively from home most of the time, pain levels are down 60%, and she's still employed at the same job.

"Other people in my situation have the same right to accommodation. They just need to know how to ask. That's what 3mpwrApp does."
