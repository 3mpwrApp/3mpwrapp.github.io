## Myth vs. Reality

Let's clear up some common misconceptions about disability benefits.

### Myth #1: "You can't work at all on disability benefits"

**Reality:** Most programs allow some work income.
- CPP-D: Up to $7,000/year (2025)
- ODSP: Various work incentives
- Provincial programs: Varies by province
- Many people work part-time while receiving benefits

**Why this matters:** You're not locked out of work. You can test your capacity, earn income, and maintain benefits simultaneously.

### Myth #2: "If you get disability benefits, you're automatically disabled forever"

**Reality:** Benefits are reviewed regularly.
- If your condition improves, you report it
- You can transition back to work gradually
- Many programs offer return-to-work supports
- You're not trapped

**Why this matters:** Getting benefits doesn't mean you give up the possibility of future employment.

### Myth #3: "Mental illness doesn't qualify for disability benefits"

**Reality:** Mental illness qualifies if it's severe and prolonged.
- Depression, anxiety, PTSD qualify
- Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder qualify
- Other mental health conditions can qualify
- You need medical documentation

**Why this matters:** Don't assume you're ineligible. Apply if you meet the criteria.

### Myth #4: "You have to be completely unable to work to qualify"

**Reality:** The test is "severe and prolonged," not "completely unable."
- You might work part-time
- You might work with heavy accommodation
- You might have good days and bad days
- Episodic conditions can qualify

**Why this matters:** You don't need to be completely incapacitated. Substantially unable to work counts.

### Myth #5: "Appealing a decision is hopeless"

**Reality:** Many appeals are successful.
- About 30% of CPP-D appeals succeed
- New evidence is powerful
- Better presentation can change outcomes
- Legal help increases success rates

**Why this matters:** If you were denied, don't give up. Appeals work.
