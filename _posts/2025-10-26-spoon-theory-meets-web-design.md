# 🥄 Spoon Theory Meets Web Design: Energy Tracking While You Browse

**Reading Time: 5 minutes** | 🔋🔋 **Energy Cost: Light**

---

## What if websites told you how much energy they'd cost?

If you live with chronic illness, disability, or injury, you know the drill: You wake up with a limited number of "spoons" (units of energy) for the day. Every activity costs spoons. And once they're gone, they're gone.

**But here's what no one talks about:** Browsing the internet costs spoons too.

- Reading complex text? Spoons.
- Navigating cluttered layouts? Spoons.
- Making decisions about what to click? Spoons.
- Processing overwhelming information? LOTS of spoons.

### The Problem

Most websites have no idea they're draining your energy. They pile on information, complex navigation, auto-playing videos, pop-ups, and flashing banners without considering: **"Can someone with limited energy actually use this?"**

You might start browsing with 5 spoons left for the day. After 10 minutes on a typical website, you're down to 2 spoons and still haven't found what you need.

## Our Solution: The World's First Spoon Counter

We built something that's never existed before: **A live counter that tracks how many spoons you're using while browsing.**

### How It Works

**1. Energy Cost Indicators (🔋)**
Every section of our website shows battery icons indicating energy cost:
- 🔋 = Very Light (1 spoon)
- 🔋🔋 = Light (2 spoons)
- 🔋🔋🔋 = Medium (3 spoons)
- 🔋🔋🔋🔋 = Heavy (4 spoons)

**Before you even start reading**, you know: "This section costs 3 spoons. Do I have that today?"

**2. Live Spoon Counter**
In the top toolbar, you see: **🥄 Energy used: 5**

This number updates in real-time as you:
- Scroll through content (+0.5 spoons every 10 seconds)
- Click links or buttons (+0.5 spoons per click)
- View energy-intensive sections (+1-4 spoons based on section)

**3. Reset Button**
At any point, click "Reset" to start fresh. This is especially helpful if you:
- Take a break and come back with more spoons
- Want to track different browsing sessions
- Share a device with someone else

## Why This Is Revolutionary

### 1. Honors Spoon Theory
Created by Christine Miserandino, spoon theory helps people explain energy limitations to others. We're the first website to operationalize it—making it a functional part of web design, not just a metaphor.

### 2. Informed Decision-Making
Instead of discovering halfway through a page that you don't have the energy to finish it, you can make informed choices:

❌ **Before:** "I'll try to read this... oh no, it's too much, I'm exhausted."

✅ **After:** "This costs 4 spoons and I only have 3. I'll save it for tomorrow."

### 3. Validates Your Experience
Seeing the counter go up validates what you've always known: **Yes, this IS hard work. Yes, you ARE using energy. It's not just you.**

### 4. Promotes Self-Care
When you see "Energy used: 8" and realize you've used more spoons than you intended, it's a clear signal: **Time to rest.**

## Real-World Use Cases

**NOTE:** These are conceptual examples of how the Spoon Counter is designed to work. We're currently preparing for Phase 1 Closed Beta testing (launching soon). Real user feedback and testimonials will be collected during beta testing with participant permission.

### Case Study 1: Morning Browser with Limited Spoons
**Sarah has fibromyalgia. She wakes up with 10 spoons for the entire day.**

**Without Spoon Counter:**
- Opens website, starts reading
- 30 minutes later, feels exhausted
- Doesn't know if she should stop or keep going
- Pushes through, crashes later

**With Spoon Counter:**
- Sees homepage costs 2 spoons (🔋🔋)
- Checks counter: "I've used 3 spoons"
- Decides to read one more section (🔋🔋 = 2 more spoons)
- Stops at 5 spoons, saves 5 for the rest of her day
- No crash, better day overall

### Case Study 2: Pain Flare Day
**Marcus has chronic back pain from a workplace injury. Today is a bad pain day—he has maybe 5 spoons total.**

**Without Spoon Counter:**
- Tries to research legal rights
- Gets overwhelmed by complex pages
- Gives up, feels defeated

**With Spoon Counter:**
- Sees most sections cost 3-4 spoons
- Activates "Pain Flare Mode" (simplified view)
- Sections now cost 1-2 spoons instead
- Successfully finds information within his 5-spoon budget
- Feels empowered, not defeated

### Case Study 3: Supporter/Ally Learning
**Jennifer's partner has chronic fatigue syndrome. She wants to understand what browsing costs them.**

**Without Spoon Counter:**
- Doesn't realize why her partner avoids certain websites
- Thinks "it's just reading, how hard can it be?"

**With Spoon Counter:**
- Browses the site herself
- Sees the counter climb: 2... 4... 7... 10 spoons
- Realizes: "Wow, this DOES cost energy!"
- Gains empathy and understanding

## The Technical Innovation

### How We Track Energy

**Passive Tracking:**
- Scroll distance and time spent
- Number of clicks/interactions
- Sections viewed (via Intersection Observer)

**Section-Based Tracking:**
Each section has a `data-energy` attribute:
```html
<span class="energy-cost" data-energy="3">🔋🔋🔋 Energy: Medium</span>
```

When you view a section (50% visible), it adds that energy cost once.

**localStorage Persistence:**
Your spoon count persists across page loads and sessions:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('spoonCount', spoonCount);
```

Come back tomorrow? Your count is still there (until you reset it).

## Customization Options

### Set Your Baseline (Coming Soon - Phase 2)
Tell us your typical daily spoon count:
- Low energy day: 5 spoons
- Medium energy day: 10 spoons
- Good energy day: 15 spoons

The counter will show percentage used: **"3/10 spoons used (30%)"**

### Energy Alerts (Coming Soon - Phase 2)
Set alerts:
- ⚠️ At 50% spoons used: "You're halfway through your energy"
- 🚨 At 80% spoons used: "Consider taking a break soon"
- 🛑 At 100% spoons used: "You've reached your energy limit for today"

### Daily Energy Reports (Coming Soon - Phase 3)
Track your patterns:
- Monday average: 8 spoons
- Tuesday average: 12 spoons
- Best browsing time: 10am-12pm (lowest cost)
- Highest cost pages: Legal documents (avg 6 spoons)

---

## Beyond Browsing: The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about our website. We're proving a concept: **Energy tracking should be standard web accessibility.**

Imagine if:
- Government websites showed energy costs for filling out forms
- Healthcare portals indicated spoon costs for appointment booking
- Shopping sites let you set an energy budget: "Show only items I can browse with 3 spoons"

**We're building the prototype. Others can follow.**

## Try It Yourself

**Right now, you can:**

1. **Look at the top toolbar** - See your current spoon count
2. **Check section headers** - Note the 🔋 energy cost indicators
3. **Browse normally** - Watch the counter increase
4. **Click "Reset"** - Start fresh anytime
5. **Use keyboard shortcut** - Alt+S to reset quickly

**Track your patterns:**
- How many spoons does the homepage cost you?
- Which sections are most energy-intensive?
- What's your browsing limit before you need a break?
