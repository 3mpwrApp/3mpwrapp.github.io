## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Doctor's Appointment
**Use the App:**
- Open Evidence Locker
- Show doctor photos of injury/symptoms
- Access medical records offline
- Log appointment notes in wellness tracker

**Why not website?** Privacy—you don't want to pull up sensitive docs in a browser where someone might see your screen.

### Scenario 2: Researching Your Rights
**Use the Website:**
- Read articles about WSIB/WCB process
- Join province-specific community forum
- Ask questions, get advice from peers
- Bookmark resources to read later

**Why not app?** This is exploratory research, not sensitive storage. Website's better for browsing and community interaction.

### Scenario 3: Writing an Appeal Letter
**Use the App:**
- Open Letter Wizard
- Generate professional appeal letter
- Save draft locally (encrypted)
- Edit over multiple sessions offline
- Send when ready

**Why not website?** The app saves drafts securely on your device. Website only shows templates you'd have to copy/paste elsewhere.

### Scenario 4: Advocacy Campaign
**Use the Website:**
- Read about current campaign
- Share link on social media
- Join community discussion about it
- Sign up for campaign updates

**Why not app?** Public advocacy is more effective through shareable web links. Apps are for private tools.

### Scenario 5: Pain Flare Day
**Use Either (or both):**

**App:**
- Log pain level in wellness tracker
- Set rest reminder notifications
- Access saved documents without scrolling

**Website:**
- Activate Pain Flare Mode
- Read simplified content
- Use spoon counter to manage energy

**Why both work?** Both have pain-aware features. Choose based on what you need to do.

---

## The Hybrid Approach (Recommended!)

### Morning Routine
📱 **App:** Log pain levels, check energy forecast, review daily tasks

### Mid-Day Research
🌐 **Website:** Read article about appealing a decision, join community discussion

### Afternoon Task
📱 **App:** Use Letter Wizard to draft appeal, save in Evidence Locker

### Evening Wind-Down
🌐 **Website:** Scroll community success stories, low-energy reading mode

## Common Questions

### "Do I need both?"
**No, but they complement each other perfectly.**
- Minimum: Use website for community + resources
- Ideal: Use app for private tools + website for community

### "Will they sync?"
**Optional BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud):**
- You can sync app data to your own cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
- Website doesn't store personal data
- Syncing is YOUR choice, YOUR cloud, YOUR control

### "Which should I start with?"
**Start with the website:**
1. Explore features, read resources
2. Join community, see what's available
3. When you're ready for private tools, download the app

**Start with the app if:**
- You already know what you need
- You want to start tracking wellness immediately
- You need offline evidence storage now

### "Can I use just one?"
**Yes!**
- **Just website:** Perfect for advocacy, community, resources
- **Just app:** Perfect for private tools, tracking, offline access

Most users find both valuable for different purposes.
