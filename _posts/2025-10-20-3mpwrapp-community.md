## Real Stories, Real Impact

Every day, people across Canada are discovering support, information, and community through 3mpwrApp. Here are some of their stories.

### "Finding My Benefits Changed Everything"

*— Jordan, Ontario*

"I didn't know about half the programs I qualified for. 3mpwrApp's resource guide helped me discover programs that cover my prescriptions and mobility aids. The step-by-step guides made the application process so much less intimidating."

### "Community Made the Difference"

*— Sam, British Columbia*

"The hardest part was feeling alone. Connecting with other people through 3mpwrApp who were going through similar experiences gave me perspective and practical advice that no government website could."

### "Accessible From Day One"

*— Alex, Alberta*

"As someone who uses a screen reader, I was impressed. The website actually works with accessibility tools. That's rare. It shows they actually care about including people with disabilities."

### "Information That Actually Helps"

*— Morgan, Quebec*

"I've been on disability benefits for years and STILL learned about new resources through 3mpwrApp's curated news. The weekly recaps save me from having to dig through endless websites."
