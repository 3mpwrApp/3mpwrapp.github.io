# SEO Content Calendar and Checklist

This lightweight calendar helps plan pillar pages, supporting posts, and internal linking.

## Pillars (evergreen)
- User Guide (features, how-to, accessibility)
- Resources (rights, templates, advocacy)
- What’s New (updates, changelogs)
- Events (calendar, ICS)

## Supporting posts (examples)
- Accessibility tips for injured workers
- How to document workplace accommodations
- Navigating benefits and claims by province
- Building peer support networks

## Keywords (starter set)
- injured workers support, disability advocacy, workplace accommodation, Canada disability benefits, WCB claims, peer support app, accessibility tools

## Internal linking rules
- Each supporting post links back to the most relevant pillar page.
- Pillars cross-link where user journeys overlap (Guide ⇄ Resources ⇄ Features).
- Add “Further reading” sections with 2–3 relevant internal links.

## Page-level SEO checklist (every page)
- Unique title (50–60 chars) and meta description (140–160 chars)
- One H1 per page; logical headings (H2-H4)
- Descriptive link text; avoid “click here”
- Image alts are meaningful; decorative images have empty alt
- Canonical URL where applicable
- JSON-LD (Organization already added; add BreadcrumbList where useful)
- Open Graph + Twitter card (jekyll-seo-tag covers basics)
- Language (html lang) is correct for page
- Mobile friendly; high contrast and focus visible
- Performance: minimal images, defer non-critical JS

## Cadence
- 2 supporting posts per week (Tue/Thu)
- Review search queries monthly; update pillars quarterly
