    title: 'Q&A: Your Top Questions About Disability Benefits Answered',
    type: 'qa',
    day: 3, // Wednesday
    excerpt: 'Common questions about CPP-D, ODSP, AISH, and other disability programs answered by experts.',
    content: `
## Common Questions About Disability Benefits

We get these questions frequently. Here are clear, straightforward answers.

### About Application

**Q: How long does a CPP-D application take?**
A: Typically 4-6 months from application to decision. Appeals can take 12-18 months depending on the level.

**Q: Do I need a lawyer for my appeal?**
A: No, but legal aid is available. Many people represent themselves successfully with good preparation.

**Q: What if my doctor won't fill out forms?**
A: You can get a different doctor, request a written explanation, or use the appeal process to challenge their position.

### About Eligibility

**Q: Can I work part-time on disability benefits?**
A: Depends on the program. CPP-D allows up to $7,000/year (2025). ODSP has work incentives. Check your program.

**Q: If I'm on workers' comp, can I also get CPP-D?**
A: Yes, but they coordinate benefits. You can't double-receive. Consult with both programs about how they interact.

**Q: Does mental illness qualify?**
A: Yes, if it meets the "severe and prolonged" test. You need medical documentation showing it's ongoing and limiting.

### About Money

**Q: Why did my benefit amount change?**
A: Benefits adjust for inflation annually. Income affects ODSP and provincial programs. Report changes to your program.

**Q: Can I save money without losing benefits?**
A: Depends on the program. ODSP has asset limits; CPP-D has no asset limits. Plan carefully.

**Q: What happens if I overpaid?**
A: You may need to repay. Work with your program office on a repayment plan.

### About Responsibilities

**Q: Do I need to report medical changes?**
A: Yes. Most programs require regular updates. Failure to report can result in overpayment or benefit loss.

**Q: What if my condition improves?**
A: Report it. You might maintain benefits if you're still unable to work. Honesty is essential.

    title: 'User Spotlight: How 3mpwrApp Changed Sarah\'s Workplace Accommodation Journey',
    type: 'userspotlight',
    day: 1, // Monday
    excerpt: 'Real stories from people using 3mpwrApp to advocate for themselves and get the support they need.',
    content: `
## Real Stories, Real Impact

Meet Sarah, a 34-year-old with rheumatoid arthritis who used 3mpwrApp to successfully negotiate a workplace accommodation.

### The Challenge

Sarah worked in an office job she loved, but her RA made sitting all day painful. She'd tried asking informally, but her employer kept saying "it's not possible."

"I knew I had rights," Sarah says, "but I didn't know how to communicate them professionally."

### The 3mpwrApp Solution

**Step 1: Learned her rights**
Sarah used 3mpwrApp's Policy Simplifier to understand Ontario's accommodation requirements. "I learned employers HAVE to accommodate," she explains.

**Step 2: Generated a professional letter**
Using the Master Letter Generator, Sarah created a formal accommodation request letter in 10 minutes. "It looked professional. It sounded like it came from a lawyer‚Äîbut I wrote it myself."

**Step 3: Documented everything**
She saved the letter and her employer's response in the Evidence Locker. "If this escalates, I have proof of everything."

**Step 4: Got her accommodation**
Within 2 weeks, Sarah's employer approved a work-from-home arrangement 3 days per week. "I think the professional letter made the difference."

### The Impact

"I didn't have to hire a lawyer. I didn't have to file a complaint. I just needed to communicate clearly and professionally. 3mpwrApp gave me the tools."

Today, Sarah works productively from home most of the time, pain levels are down 60%, and she's still employed at the same job.

"Other people in my situation have the same right to accommodation. They just need to know how to ask. That's what 3mpwrApp does."

    title: 'Myth Busting: 5 Common Misconceptions About Disability Benefits',
    type: 'mythbusting',
    day: 4, // Thursday
    excerpt: 'Debunking common myths about disability programs, work incentives, and your rights.',
    content: `
## Myth vs. Reality

Let's clear up some common misconceptions about disability benefits.

### Myth #1: "You can't work at all on disability benefits"

**Reality:** Most programs allow some work income.
- CPP-D: Up to $7,000/year (2025)
- ODSP: Various work incentives
- Provincial programs: Varies by province
- Many people work part-time while receiving benefits

**Why this matters:** You're not locked out of work. You can test your capacity, earn income, and maintain benefits simultaneously.

### Myth #2: "If you get disability benefits, you're automatically disabled forever"

**Reality:** Benefits are reviewed regularly.
- If your condition improves, you report it
- You can transition back to work gradually
- Many programs offer return-to-work supports
- You're not trapped

**Why this matters:** Getting benefits doesn't mean you give up the possibility of future employment.

### Myth #3: "Mental illness doesn't qualify for disability benefits"

**Reality:** Mental illness qualifies if it's severe and prolonged.
- Depression, anxiety, PTSD qualify
- Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder qualify
- Other mental health conditions can qualify
- You need medical documentation

**Why this matters:** Don't assume you're ineligible. Apply if you meet the criteria.

### Myth #4: "You have to be completely unable to work to qualify"

**Reality:** The test is "severe and prolonged," not "completely unable."
- You might work part-time
- You might work with heavy accommodation
- You might have good days and bad days
- Episodic conditions can qualify

**Why this matters:** You don't need to be completely incapacitated. Substantially unable to work counts.

### Myth #5: "Appealing a decision is hopeless"

**Reality:** Many appeals are successful.
- About 30% of CPP-D appeals succeed
- New evidence is powerful
- Better presentation can change outcomes
- Legal help increases success rates

**Why this matters:** If you were denied, don't give up. Appeals work.

    title: 'Wellness Tip: 5 Energy Management Strategies That Work',
    type: 'wellness',
    day: 5, // Friday
    excerpt: 'Practical strategies for managing energy and preventing burnout with a disability.',
    content: `
## Energy Management That Actually Works

Energy is precious. Here are 5 strategies that help real people.

### Strategy 1: Energy Coins (Budgeting Model)

Assign each activity a "cost" in energy coins:
- Morning routine: 1-2 coins
- Email: 1 coin per batch
- Video call: 2 coins
- Shopping: 3 coins
- Doctor appointment: 4 coins

**Daily budget:** Whatever feels realistic (10-20 coins is common)

**The benefit:** You see what you can actually do. You make conscious choices.

**How 3mpwrApp helps:** Use the Energy Coins tool to track and plan.

### Strategy 2: Energy Cycles

Track when you have energy across days/weeks:
- Are mornings better? Afternoons?
- Do you have a good day every 3 days?
- Do weekends recover you?
- When do medications work best?

**The benefit:** You schedule important tasks for high-energy times.

**How 3mpwrApp helps:** The Energy Forecast uses ML to predict your patterns.

### Strategy 3: Pacing, Not Pushing

The temptation: Push when you have energy, crash later.
Better approach: Save some energy, maintain steady pace.

**The 50% rule:** Do only 50% of what you think you can do. Save the rest for recovery.

**The benefit:** No crashes. Consistency. Sustainable living.

### Strategy 4: Batch Similar Tasks

Instead of context-switching all day:
- Email time: 30 minutes (all at once)
- Phone calls: 30 minutes (all at once)
- Writing: 2 hours (one block)
- Movement: 3 x 10 minutes (spread out)

**The benefit:** Less startup energy. Better focus. Less exhaustion.

### Strategy 5: Built-In Recovery Time

After hard tasks, build in recovery:
- After doctor: Rest
- After social: Solo time
- After work: No obligations
- After errands: Quiet evening

**The benefit:** You prevent crashes. You recover better.

    excerpt: 'In-depth conversation with leaders in disability justice, accessibility, and advocacy.',
    content: `
## Interview Series: Voices in Disability Justice

We're talking with leaders shaping disability rights, accessibility, and justice. This month: Dr. Sarah Chen.

### About Dr. Chen

Dr. Sarah Chen is an accessibility researcher, disability justice advocate, and founder of the Tech for All Institute.

**Background:**
- PhD in Accessible Technology
- 15+ years in disability advocacy
- Recognized expert in inclusive design
- Author of "Disability Justice Technology"

### The Interview

**Q: What's the biggest barrier to accessible technology?**

"It's often not the technology itself. It's the mindset. Developers design for themselves, not for the full spectrum of human difference. Accessibility isn't a feature‚Äîit's a foundation. Every decision in design is an accessibility decision."

**Q: How is disability justice different from accessibility?**

"Accessibility is making things work for disabled people. Disability justice is about centering disabled people's leadership and power. It's the difference between 'we'll add accessibility' and 'disabled people are leading this from the start.'"

**Q: What does good accessibility look like?**

"When nobody notices it's accessible. When a person using a screen reader, using voice input, using a switch control, or using mouse and keyboard all find the system equally usable. When it's so natural, nobody's thinking about it."

**Q: What's your advice for organizations building tech?**

"First: Hire disabled people. Not after the fact. From day one. Second: Do real testing with real disabled people, not simulation. Third: Listen to what disabled people say and actually change things."

**Q: How do you stay hopeful?**

"I see apps like 3mpwrApp. I see disabled people building tools for themselves. I see young disabled people demanding better. Hope isn't something I generate‚Äîit's something I witness every day."

### Dr. Chen's Recommendations

**For Disability Advocates:**
- Build your own tools
- Don't wait for accessible versions
- Lead from your lived experience
- Demand better

**For Tech Companies:**
- Hire disabled people
- Test with real users
- Listen and adapt
- Make it foundational

**For Organizations:**
- Accessibility = better for everyone
- Invest upfront
- Lead with disabled people
- Keep iterating

    day: 2, // Tuesday
    excerpt: 'See how 3mpwrApp gathers, analyzes, and selects news that matters to the disability community.',
    content: `
## How It Works: Daily News Curation

Ever wonder how 3mpwrApp picks which news to feature? Let's look behind the curtain.

### The Pipeline

#### üåç Step 1: Collection (6 AM UTC)
- 26 Canadian RSS feeds monitored
- Sources include:
  - Government agencies
  - Disability organizations
  - Workers compensation boards
  - News outlets
  - Policy organizations
- Collects 100-150 items daily

**Why these sources?**
"We focus on Canadian content from trusted sources," explains our curation team. "Government feeds, disability organizations, and workers comp boards‚Äîthe places real information lives."

#### ü§ñ Step 2: Automated Analysis (6-7 AM UTC)
Each item gets scored on:
- **Relevance** (1-18 points)
  - Keyword matches (disability, workers comp, policy, etc.)
  - Disability angle presence
  - Advocacy connection

- **Recency** (weights)
  - Today: +100%
  - Yesterday: +50%
  - This week: +25%
  - Older: Standard

- **Source Quality** (multipliers)
  - Government sources: √ó1.3
  - Major disability orgs: √ó1.2
  - News outlets: √ó1.0
  - Community sources: √ó0.8

#### üìã Step 3: Deduplication
- Levenshtein distance algorithm
- 85% similarity threshold
- Removes duplicates from multiple sources
- Keeps one version, removes repeats

#### ‚úÖ Step 4: Selection (7-8 AM UTC)
- Top 25 items by score selected
- Minimum score threshold: 1.5
- Maximum items: 25
- Posts to blog

#### üì± Step 5: Distribution (8 AM UTC)
- Blog post published
- JSON API updated
- Social media posts generated
- Community notified

### The Numbers

**Daily Metrics (avg):**
- Items collected: 127
- Items analyzed: 127
- Items selected: 25
- Selection rate: 19.7%
- Processing time: <5 seconds

**Why so selective?**
"We'd rather deliver 25 really relevant items than 100 mediocre ones," our team explains. "Quality over quantity helps busy people stay informed without overload."

### The Technology

**Stack:**
- Node.js (no external API dependencies)
- Built-in HTTPS (no npm packages)
- HTML entity decoding (handles special characters)
- CDATA parsing (WordPress feeds)
- Levenshtein distance (deduplication)

**Why?**
"We wanted zero dependencies, complete privacy, and fast performance," explains our dev team. "Everything runs on your device. No cloud processing. No tracking."

### Human Touch

"The algorithm does the heavy lifting," says curator Maria, "but we also review manually. Sometimes context matters more than keywords. If something feels important to our community, we include it."

### What Gets Filtered

‚ùå Spam and advertisements  
‚ùå Duplicate/near-duplicate items  
‚ùå Low-relevance items  
‚ùå Outdated information  
‚ùå Content below quality threshold  

‚úÖ Policy changes affecting disabled people  
‚úÖ Workers compensation updates  
‚úÖ Accessibility improvements  
‚úÖ Disability rights news  
‚úÖ Community announcements  

### Feedback

"We get lots of feedback: 'I wish you covered this,' or 'This article wasn't relevant.' We listen," Maria says. "Future versions will have user-selected keywords and personalized alerts."

### The Goal

"We're trying to solve information overload while avoiding filter bubbles," explains the team. "Disability news is scattered. We bring it together. We make it manageable. We make it relevant."
