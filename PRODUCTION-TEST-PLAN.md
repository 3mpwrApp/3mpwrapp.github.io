# 3mpowr App Website: Production/Pre-Release Testing Plan

**Document Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** DRAFT – Ready for Execution  
**Prepared for:** Pre-Launch Quality Assurance & Compliance  

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines a comprehensive, prioritized testing strategy to validate the 3mpowr App website for production launch. The plan covers stress testing, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA + 2.2 guidance), security assessments (OWASP Top 10), performance benchmarking, and user flow validation across desktop/mobile and major browsers.

### Testing Goals

1. **Verify zero critical/high security findings** unmitigated
2. **Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** with WCAG 2.2 guidance where applicable
3. **Sustain 95th percentile page load <3.0s** on desktop/mobile from key regions
4. **Support ≥500 concurrent users** with <1% error rate under 3–5 minute sustained traffic
5. **Pass all major user flows** (homepage, features, resources, contact, newsletter signup, etc.) as E2E tests
6. **Enable continuous monitoring** post-launch via CI/CD checkpoints

### Risk Matrix

| **Severity** | **Definition** | **SLA** | **Examples** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | Complete feature loss, security breach, data loss, >10% error rate | Remediate before launch | RCE, auth bypass, XSS, 503 errors |
| **High** | Major feature impaired, significant user friction, >5% error rate | Remediate or document exception | Slow load (>5s), broken payment, WCAG failure blocking content access |
| **Medium** | Minor usability issue, <5% error rate, compliance gap | Remediate in v1.1 or document | Slow API (>2s), minor contrast issue, missing optional label |
| **Low** | UX polish, nice-to-have, <1% impact | Post-launch backlog | Typo, color suggestion, animation stutter |

## Testing Environments

### Staging Environment

**URL:** `https://3mpwrapp.github.io` (production site, but treated as staging for testing)  
**Alternative:** Deploy to Cloudflare Pages staging branch for isolated testing  
**Duration:** Full test suite: 1–2 weeks  

**Seeded Test Data:**
- Blog posts with mixed content (text, images, videos, tables, code blocks)
- Multilingual resources (EN, FR, ES, AR, ZH)
- Accessibility feature demonstrations (contrast toggle, font scaling examples)

**Test Accounts & Credentials:**

| **Role** | **Email** | **Password** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|---|---|

- **pa11y-ci:** Run on every push – validates WCAG 2.1 AA across all pages
- **axe-core:** Run on every push – detects common violations
- **Lighthouse:** Weekly audit – accessibility subscore ≥95

**Manual Testing (Before Launch):**
1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Navigate all pages using Tab/Shift+Tab only
   - Verify logical tab order, no keyboard traps
   - Test focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
   - Check modal dialogs can be closed with ESC

2. **Screen Reader Testing**
   - NVDA on Windows (latest version)
   - JAWS on Windows (latest version – optional if NVDA passes)
   - VoiceOver on macOS/iOS
   - Test announcements for dynamic content
   - Verify all images have meaningful alt text
   - Confirm form labels and error messages are announced

3. **Visual Accessibility**
   - Contrast Analyzer: Verify all text ≥4.5:1 (AA) or ≥7:1 (AAA)
   - Test page with zoom to 200% – no layout breaks
   - Disable CSS – verify content still readable in source order
   - Color Blind Simulator: Verify no color-only instructions

4. **Assistive Technology**
   - Speech recognition testing (Windows Speech Recognition or dragon NaturallySpeaking)
   - Screen magnifier testing (Windows Magnifier, Zoom, MacOS Zoom)
   - Text-to-speech: Confirm content is read correctly

5. **Specific WCAG 2.2 Checks**
   - **2.4.11 Focus Appearance (AA):** Focus outline ≥3px, 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors
   - **2.5.8 Target Size (AA):** All interactive elements ≥24×24px (preferably 44×44px)
   - **2.4.12 Focus Not Obscured (AA):** Sticky header doesn't hide focused element
   - **2.5.7 Dragging (AA):** No dragging-only interactions (N/A for this site)

**Deliverable:** Accessibility Audit Report (see template below)

   - Verify error messages don't leak system info

7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (A03:2021)**
   - Test all user input fields (search, forms, URL parameters)
   - Payload examples: `"><script>alert('XSS')</script>`, `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`, `<svg onload=alert('XSS')>`
   - Verify CSP blocks inline scripts

8. **Insecure Deserialization (A08:2021)**
   - N/A (no serialized objects)

9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities (A06:2021)**
   - Run `npm audit` and `bundle audit` weekly
   - Update all dependencies with patches
   - Monitor CVE databases for Jekyll/Minima theme

10. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (A09:2021)**
    - Verify error logs are not exposed publicly
    - Check GitHub Actions logs don't leak secrets
    - Implement uptime monitoring (Cloudflare, UptimeRobot)
