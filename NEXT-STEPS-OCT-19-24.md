## RISK MITIGATION

### If E2E Tests Fail

| Issue | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Environment issue | Reset and re-run | 15 min |
| Test code bug | Fix and re-run | 15 min |
| Website bug | Fix website, re-run | 30 min |
| Blocked by unknown | Escalate to team | Immediate |

**Fallback:** Manual testing can substitute if needed (less efficient but works)

### If Cross-Browser Issues Found

| Severity | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Critical | Fix immediately, re-test | 30 min |
| High | Fix today, verify tomorrow | 1 hour |
| Medium | Fix before launch | 24 hours |
| Low | Document as known issue | N/A |

**Fallback:** Progressive enhancement (basic features work everywhere)

### If Performance Degrades

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Slow homepage | Enable aggressive caching |
| Slow images | Enable image optimization |
| Slow API | Check CDN, check origin |
| Slow analytics | Load analytics async |

**Fallback:** Rollback to previous version within 30 minutes
