**Why First:** Activates your security headers, makes site faster globally.

### Steps:
1. Go to: https://pages.cloudflare.com/
2. Sign up (no credit card)
3. Connect GitHub: `3mpwrApp/3mpwrapp.github.io`
4. Build settings:

## üü† PRIORITY 2: Add Microsoft Clarity Code (5 minutes)

You have the tracking code - let's add it!

**Provide your Clarity code and I'll add it to `_includes/custom-head.html`**

It should look like:
```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function(c,l,a,r,i,t,y){
    c[a]=c[a]||function(){(c[a].q=c[a].q||[]).push(arguments)};
    t=l.createElement(r);t.async=1;t.src="https://www.clarity.ms/tag/"+i;
    y=l.getElementsByTagName(r)[0];y.parentNode.insertBefore(t,y);
  })(window, document, "clarity", "script", "YOUR_PROJECT_ID");
</script>
```

**Result:** See exactly how users interact with site. Find usability issues.

4. Set alert email
5. Create public status page (free subdomain)

**Result:** Get notified if site goes down.

### B. Verify Google Search Console (5 min)
1. Google verification file already uploaded! ‚úÖ
2. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
3. Add property: `3mpwrapp.github.io`
