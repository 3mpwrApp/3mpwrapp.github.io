2. Run image optimization:
   ```bash
   node scripts/optimize-images.js
   ```
3. Update image references to WebP:
   ```liquid
   {% include webp-picture.html src="..." alt="..." %}
   ```
4. Test all images in browsers
5. Commit and deploy
6. Run Lighthouse audit

**Expected Results:**
- Performance: 61% → 80%+ (+19 points)
- FCP: 4.2s → 2.5s

3. Defer non-critical CSS
4. Use `media="print"` trick with `onload`

**Expected Results:**
- Performance: +3-5 points
- FCP: -0.5-1.0s

---

### **Phase 7: Code Splitting (Low Priority)**

**Goal:** Reduce JavaScript execution time

**Steps:**
