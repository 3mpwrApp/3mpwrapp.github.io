## Privacy & Data

### Who owns my data?

**YOU DO.** 100% of your data belongs to you, not us. We never claim ownership of your content, evidence, wellness data, or anything you create in the app.

**[Read our Data Ownership Statement ‚Üí](/data-ownership/)**

### Where is my data stored?

That depends on which privacy mode you choose:

- **Default Mode:** On your device by default, optional backup to Firebase (our secure cloud)
- **Hybrid BYOC Mode:** On your device AND your chosen cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- **Strict BYOC Mode:** Only on your device and YOUR chosen cloud (we never see it)

**[Learn about privacy modes ‚Üí](/privacy-controls/#choose-your-privacy-mode)**

### Can you see my data?

**In Default Mode:** Only if you enable cloud backup (and even then, it's encrypted)  
**In Hybrid Mode:** We handle your login, but never see your content  
**In Strict Mode:** No - we're completely disconnected, the app only talks to YOUR cloud

### Do you sell my data?

**ABSOLUTELY NOT.** We will never sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties. This is a core promise we will never break.

### How secure is my data?

- **Military-grade encryption** (AES-256, same as banks use)
- **Hardware-backed security** (encryption keys stored in your device's secure chip)
- **Secure connections** (all network traffic encrypted with HTTPS/TLS)
- **No backdoors** (we don't have access keys to your encrypted data)

**[Read our Privacy Policy ‚Üí](/privacy/)**

### Can I delete my data?

**YES!** You have the right to delete:
- Your entire account (permanently)
- Individual pieces of data (selective deletion)
- All cloud backups (if you use them)

Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

## BYOC Modes Explained

### What does BYOC mean?

**BYOC = Bring Your Own Cloud**

It means you can connect your own cloud storage provider (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Nextcloud, etc.) and have ALL your data stored there instead of on our servers.

### What's the difference between the three privacy modes?

| Feature | Default Mode | Hybrid BYOC ‚≠ê | Strict BYOC |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Login** | Easy (email, Google, Apple) | Easy (email, Google, Apple) | Custom only |
| **Your data location** | Device + optional Firebase | Device + YOUR cloud | Device + YOUR cloud |
| **What we can see** | Only what you backup | Only your login, never content | Nothing at all |
| **Setup difficulty** | üü¢ Easy | üü° Medium | üî¥ Advanced |
| **Best for** | Most users | Privacy + convenience | Maximum privacy |

### Which mode should I choose?

**Default Mode** - Start here if you're new and want the easiest experience

**Hybrid BYOC Mode** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED** - Best balance of easy login + full data privacy

**Strict BYOC Mode** - For maximum privacy advocates, healthcare settings, or legal work requiring complete air-gap

You can switch modes anytime in Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security.

### What cloud providers are supported?

**ANY cloud storage that supports standard protocols:**

- ‚úÖ Google Drive
- ‚úÖ Dropbox
- ‚úÖ Microsoft OneDrive
- ‚úÖ Apple iCloud
- ‚úÖ Nextcloud
- ‚úÖ ownCloud
- ‚úÖ AWS S3
- ‚úÖ Azure Storage
- ‚úÖ Any WebDAV-compatible service
- ‚úÖ Your own server

### Do I need technical skills for BYOC modes?

**Hybrid Mode:** No - if you can sign into Google Drive or Dropbox, you can use Hybrid Mode

**Strict Mode:** Some technical knowledge helpful (knowing what WebDAV is, how to connect to cloud storage)
