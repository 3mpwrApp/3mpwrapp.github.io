# Events

We’re working on bringing the in-app events calendar to the website.

Options we can support:

- Embed a public Google Calendar or ICS-powered calendar.
- Fetch an ICS or JSON feed during CI and render accessible event cards.
- Client-side fetch from an API (if CORS allows), with a static fallback.

Provide an ICS or API URL and we’ll wire it up. For now, here’s a placeholder.
