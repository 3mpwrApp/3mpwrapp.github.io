# Events

The website calendar will become available during Beta Testers Phase 1 (Closed Internal Testing) — announcement coming soon.

About the feed

- The app exposes a text/calendar (ICS) feed built from the events service.
- The feed has a 5‑minute cache window on the server to balance freshness and performance.
- You can paste the ICS URL into most CMS calendar widgets or subscribe in Google Calendar.

When the URL is ready, we’ll wire the integration and publish the calendar on this page.
