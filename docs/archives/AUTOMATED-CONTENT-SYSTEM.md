## 🚫 ANTI-REPETITION RULES

### Content Freshness Checks
**Before publishing, system checks:**

1. **Topic Recency:** Has this exact topic been covered in last 30 days?
   - If YES → Generate different angle or skip
   
2. **Angle Diversity:** Have we used this angle in last 60 days?
   - If YES → Rotate to different angle from matrix
   
3. **Keyword Overlap:** Does this post share >70% keywords with recent post?
   - If YES → Rewrite with fresh keywords
   
4. **Content Similarity:** Is this >50% similar to existing posts?
   - If YES → Add unique case study, data, or perspective

### Content Rotation System
**Ensures variety:**
- Educational posts (30%)
- Community stories (20%)
- Feature spotlights (20%)
- News/updates (15%)
- Tips/how-tos (15%)

**Never publish:**
- Same category 2 days in row
- Same feature spotlight within 30 days
- Similar topics within 14 days
