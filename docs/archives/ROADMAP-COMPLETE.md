## 🔥 The Revolutionary Features Explained

**What makes them "never-before-seen"?**

1. **Collective Bargaining Intelligence**: No platform has ever aggregated disability denial patterns to expose systemic discrimination and build class actions.

2. **Accessibility Innovation Lab**: No platform has crowdsourced DIY assistive tech in a patent-free, open-source marketplace.

3. **Trauma-Informed AI**: No advocacy tool has integrated mental health awareness with crisis detection and emotional support.

4. **Evidence Blockchain**: No disability platform uses blockchain for tamper-proof evidence preservation.

5. **Union Solidarity Network**: No platform connects cross-union disabled workers with collective agreement databases and bargaining support.

6. **Compliance Scoreboard**: No one has publicly rated employers/insurers on disability accessibility (like Yelp for disability rights).

7. **Peer Evidence Sharing**: No platform crowdsources winning legal strategies and templates from the community.

8. **Intersectional Justice**: No disability platform tracks how race/gender/sexuality affect claim outcomes.

9. **Legislative Change Engine**: No platform transforms individual cases into automated policy advocacy campaigns.

10. **Mutual Aid Network**: No disability app has built-in economic solidarity (skills exchange, time banking, resource sharing).

**Each one is truly unprecedented.** 🌟
