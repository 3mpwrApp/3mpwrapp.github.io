## SECURITY FIXES - QUICK START

### Fix #1: Update Focus Indicator (30 min)
**File:** `assets/css/styles.css`
```css
*:focus {
  outline: 3px solid #0066CC;  /* Dark blue */
  outline-offset: 2px;
  scroll-margin-top: 60px;  /* Sticky header clearance */
}
```

### Fix #2: Add SRI Hashes (45 min)
**File:** `_layouts/default.html`
```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/lib.js"
  integrity="sha384-ABC123..."
  crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
```

### Fix #3: Secure Cookies (15 min)
**File:** `_includes/head.html`
```javascript
gtag('config', 'GA-ID', {
  'cookie_flags': 'SameSite=Strict;Secure',
  'anonymize_ip': true
});
```

### Fix #4: Verify Color Contrast (1 hour)
```bash
pa11y https://3mpwrapp.github.io/
# Fix any <4.5:1 contrast issues
```
