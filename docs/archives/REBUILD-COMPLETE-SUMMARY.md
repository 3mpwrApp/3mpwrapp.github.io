## 📈 Impact Analysis

### Before Rebuild ❌
```
❌ 2 conflicting workflows (1 PM Toronto + 9 AM UTC)
❌ 6+ duplicate/redundant scripts
❌ Inconsistent configuration
❌ Poor error handling
❌ Hard to maintain
❌ High launch risk
❌ Confusing architecture
Result: Messy, uncertain, risky
```

### After Rebuild ✅
```
✅ 1 unified workflow (9 AM UTC only)
✅ 3 focused, clean scripts
✅ Centralized configuration
✅ Systematic error handling
✅ Easy to maintain
✅ Low launch risk
✅ Clear architecture
Result: Clean, confident, production-ready
```
