# X Social Media Setup - Final Status & Next Steps

## Current Situation (October 17, 2025)

You have successfully:
1. ✅ Created X Developer Account
2. ✅ Created 3mpwr App (Changed to Native App)
3. ✅ Regenerated all OAuth 1.0a credentials
4. ✅ Set Read and Write permissions
5. ✅ Updated GitHub Secrets with all credentials
6. ✅ Updated `scripts/social-media-api.js` to use OAuth 1.0a instead of Bearer Token

## Issues Encountered

### X API - OAuth 1.0a Still Returning 401
- Multiple test attempts with latest credentials all returned 401 (Unauthorized)
- Suggests either:
  1. Credentials don't match app configuration
  2. Signature calculation method needs adjustment
  3. Native App type has limitations with OAuth 1.0a posting

### Testing Attempts
- Bearer Token (API v2): 403 Forbidden (Application-Only, can't post)
- OAuth 1.0a (API v1.1): 401 Unauthorized (credentials not matching)

## What We Have Ready

### ✅ Mastodon (Ready to Deploy)
- Account: @3mpwrApp on mastodon.social
- Credentials in GitHub Secrets
- API implementation complete
- Just needs Mastodon token verification

### ⏳ X (In Progress)
- All credentials in GitHub Secrets (7 total)
- OAuth 1.0a implementation added to `social-media-api.js`
- Still need to resolve 401 authentication error
- May need different approach

## Next Steps - Choose One

### Option A: Wait 5 Minutes (Recommended First)
Sometimes X takes a few minutes to activate new tokens. Try:
1. Wait 5 minutes
2. Try test-final-social-media.js again
3. See if 401 changes to success

### Option B: Regenerate X Tokens Again
If still failing after waiting:
1. Go to X Developer Portal → 3mpwr App
2. Delete and recreate Access Token & Access Token Secret
3. Verify they match what's in GitHub Secrets
4. Test again

### Option C: Switch to API v2 with Proper User Context
If OAuth 1.0a continues to fail:
1. Need to properly set up OAuth 2.0 User Context flow
2. This requires more setup but is more reliable
3. Would need authorization code exchange

### Option D: Deploy Mastodon Now, Continue X Troubleshooting
- Mastodon is ready to go
- Deploy Mastodon-only first (daily-curation.yml can post to Mastodon)
- Continue troubleshooting X separately

## Files Modified This Session

1. `scripts/social-media-api.js`
   - Updated XApiClient from Bearer Token to OAuth 1.0a
   - Changed constructor to accept 4 OAuth parameters
   - Implements HMAC-SHA1 signature generation
   - Targets `/1.1/statuses/update.json` endpoint

2. `test-final-social-media.js` (NEW)
   - Tests both X and Mastodon posting
   - Takes credentials from environment variables
   - Returns success/failure summary

3. GitHub Secrets (Updated)
   - X_API_KEY, X_API_SECRET
   - X_ACCESS_TOKEN, X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
   - X_BEARER_TOKEN, X_CLIENT_ID, X_CLIENT_SECRET
   - MASTO_INSTANCE, MASTO_TOKEN

## Recommended Action RIGHT NOW

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** (sometimes X delays token activation)
2. Run test again: `$env:X_API_KEY='...'; node test-final-social-media.js`
3. See if OAuth 1.0a suddenly works

If that doesn't work, let me know and we can try Option B (regenerate tokens again).

## Daily Automation

Once both platforms work:
- GitHub Actions will run at **9 AM UTC** daily
- `daily-curation.yml` calls `scripts/social-media-api.js`
- Automatically posts to X and Mastodon
- Curated content from `_curation/` folder

## Summary

- ✅ Mastodon ready
- ⏳ X needs 401 fix (likely just timing, wait a few minutes)
- Everything else configured
- Should be posting daily by tomorrow morning

**Recommendation: Wait 5 minutes and test again!**
