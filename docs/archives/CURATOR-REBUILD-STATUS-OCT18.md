## 🏗️ New Architecture

```
OLD (Broken):
  ❌ daily-curator.yml (1 PM Toronto)
  ❌ daily-curation.yml (9 AM UTC)
  ❌ daily-curator.js (old)
  ❌ post-mastodon.js, post-to-mastodon.js (duplicates)
  ❌ unified-curation-engine.js (unused)
  Result: Conflicts, duplicates, confusion

NEW (Clean):
  ✅ curator.yml (unified workflow, 9 AM UTC)
  ✅ curator-core.js (main curation)
  ✅ social-post.js (all platforms)
  ✅ curator-config.js (central config)
  Result: Clean, maintainable, efficient
```
