## Severity Definitions

### Critical üî¥
**Impact:** Complete feature loss, security breach, data loss, application crash  
**Error Rate:** >10% of users affected  
**SLA:** Fix before production launch  
**Examples:**
- RCE (remote code execution)
- Authentication bypass
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) in public input
- Page returns 500 error consistently
- Lost ability to complete critical user flow
- Data corruption or loss

**Remediation Steps:**
1. Assign immediately to senior developer
2. Fix takes priority over all other work
3. Re-test within 2 hours
4. Require code review before merge
5. Document in postmortem

---

### High üü†
**Impact:** Major feature impaired, significant user friction, >5% error rate  
**SLA:** Fix within 24 hours  
**Examples:**
- Feature only partially functional (e.g., form submits but validation missing)
- Page loads but some content missing/broken
- Broken link to key resource
- Slow performance (>5s load time)
- WCAG accessibility failure blocking content
- UI layout broken on major device (e.g., mobile)
- Missing security header (CSP, HSTS)

**Remediation Steps:**
1. Assign to developer within 1 hour
2. Create fix + unit test
3. Code review required
4. Regression test before merge
5. Document in release notes

---

### Medium üü°
**Impact:** Minor usability issue, <5% error rate, minor compliance gap  
**SLA:** Fix within 2 weeks  
**Examples:**
- Typo in content
- Minor contrast issue (but still readable)
- Optional form label missing
- Missing recommended accessibility feature
- Slow API response (>2s but <5s)
- CSS animation stutter
- 404 on low-traffic page

**Remediation Steps:**
1. Assign to developer within 3 days
2. Fix included in next sprint
3. Can be bundled with other medium fixes
4. Basic testing sufficient

---

### Low üîµ
**Impact:** UX polish, nice-to-have, <1% impact  
**SLA:** Post-launch backlog  
**Examples:**
- Color suggestion
- Content refinement
- Animation polish
- Improved error messaging
- Documentation typo
- Minor spacing adjustment

**Remediation Steps:**
1. Add to backlog
2. Include in next release cycle
3. Bundle with feature work
4. Minimal testing
