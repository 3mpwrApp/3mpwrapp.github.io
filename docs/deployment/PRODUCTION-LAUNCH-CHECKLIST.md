## 🔧 Quick Reference: Manual Social Media Test

**To manually test a single platform before launch:**

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended - Oct 23)

1. Go to: https://github.com/3mpowrApp/3mpwrapp.github.io/actions
2. Click "Daily News Curation" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button (blue)
4. Set: `debug_mode=true` (for logs)
5. Click "Run workflow"
6. Wait 2-3 minutes
7. Check your profiles:
   - 🐘 https://mastodon.social/@3mpwrApp
   - 🦋 https://bsky.app/profile/3mpwrapp.bsky.social
   - 🐦 https://x.com/3mpowrapp0816

### Option 2: Manual Node Script (For Developers)

Since credentials are in GitHub Secrets (not accessible locally), credentials must be configured:

```bash
# Would need to be set locally:
export MASTO_INSTANCE=mastodon.social
export MASTO_TOKEN=your_token_here
node scripts/post-to-mastodon.js

# Same for Bluesky:
export BLUESKY_HANDLE=3mpwrapp.bsky.social
export BLUESKY_PASSWORD=your_password
node scripts/post-to-bluesky.js
```
