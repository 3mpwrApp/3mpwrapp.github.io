Subject: Free Platform for Your Community - Partnership Opportunity

Dear [Name/Organization],

I'm writing to share a resource that could significantly help your 
community members.

I've created 3mpowr, a completely free, open-source platform for injured 
workers navigating disability systems. Built with input from the disability 
community, it includes:

• Master Letter Generator (22+ legal letter types)
• Disability Documentation Wizard
• Indigenous language support (Cree, Ojibwe, Inuktitut)
• WCAG 2.2 AAA accessibility (screen reader tested)
• Zero cost, no ads, no data collection

Website: https://3mpwrapp.pages.dev

Would you be open to:
1. Sharing this with your community (newsletter, social media)
2. Adding to your resources page
3. Providing feedback from your perspective

I'm happy to create custom guides specifically for your audience or adjust 
features based on your community's needs.

This is entirely volunteer-run. No commercial interests. Just trying to 
help people navigate an overwhelming system.

Would love to discuss how we can work together.

Best regards,
[Your name]

P.S. - Happy to provide references or discuss in more detail. I know 
unsolicited emails can be skeptical!
```

**Send to:**
1. National Organization on Disability
2. American Association of People with Disabilities  
3. Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund
4. AFL-CIO
5. National Employment Law Project
6. Legal Aid Society
7. Your state's workers' rights organization
8. Local university disability studies program
