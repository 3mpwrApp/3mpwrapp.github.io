## 🚨 Known Limitations

### Calendar App Sync Delays
- **iOS/macOS**: No manual refresh, syncs every few hours
- **Google Calendar**: Up to 24-hour delay, no way to force sync
- **Outlook**: Varies by settings (hourly to daily)

**Workaround**: Direct users to check website for instant updates (refreshes every 5 minutes)

### Timezone Edge Cases
- Events are stored in UTC
- Calendar apps handle conversion
- If traveling across timezones, events may need 24 hours to adjust

**Workaround**: Events display correct time on website immediately

### Cache Delays
- ICS feed cached for 1 hour (Cloudflare KV)
- Very new events (< 1 hour old) may not appear in calendar apps yet
- Website always shows latest (5-minute refresh)

**Workaround**: Expected behavior, not a bug. Users will see events within normal sync times.
