# 🐘 Mastodon Auto-Post Setup Guide

Your daily curator can automatically post to Mastodon when it finds great content! Here's how to set it up (100% free).

---

## 📋 What You're Setting Up

When your curator runs at 1pm Toronto time and finds quality content, it will automatically post to your Mastodon account:

**Example post:**
> Daily highlights for 2025-10-14 are live: https://3mpwrapp.pages.dev/
> 
> #Accessibility #A11y #Disability #Canada

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Mastodon Application (You're here!)

You're currently at: https://mastodon.social/settings/applications/new

**Fill out the form:**

1. **Application name:** `3mpowr Daily Curator`
   - This is just for your reference

2. **Application website:** `https://3mpwrapp.pages.dev`
   - Your website URL

3. **Redirect URI:** `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`
   - Leave as default (required for token generation)

4. **Scopes:** ⚠️ **IMPORTANT - Uncheck everything except:**
   - ✅ **write:statuses** (This is the ONLY one you need)
   - ❌ Uncheck all `read:*` scopes
   - ❌ Uncheck all other `write:*` scopes
   - ❌ Uncheck `admin:*` scopes
   
   **Why?** Security! Only give the minimum permission needed to post.

5. Click **"Submit"**

---

### Step 2: Get Your Access Token

After clicking Submit, you'll see your new application. Click on it to view details.

**You'll see:**
- **Client key** (you don't need this)
- **Client secret** (you don't need this)
- **Your access token** ← This is what you need! 

**Copy the access token** - it looks like: `xyzABC123def456...` (long string)

⚠️ **Security tip:** This token lets apps post as you. Keep it secret! Never share it publicly.

---

### Step 3: Add Secrets to GitHub

Now we'll give your GitHub Actions workflow the credentials to post.

1. **Go to your GitHub repository:**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/3mpwrApp/3mpwrapp.github.io

2. **Open Settings:**
   - Click **"Settings"** tab (top right)

3. **Navigate to Secrets:**
   - In left sidebar: Click **"Secrets and variables"** → **"Actions"**

4. **Add First Secret - Mastodon Instance:**
   - Click **"New repository secret"**
   - **Name:** `MASTO_INSTANCE`
   - **Value:** `https://mastodon.social`
   - Click **"Add secret"**

5. **Add Second Secret - Mastodon Token:**
   - Click **"New repository secret"** again
   - **Name:** `MASTO_TOKEN`
   - **Value:** Paste your access token from Step 2
   - Click **"Add secret"**

---

### Step 4: Test It! (Optional but Recommended)

Let's make sure it works before waiting until tomorrow at 1pm.

1. **Go to Actions tab:**
   - https://github.com/3mpwrApp/3mpwrapp.github.io/actions

2. **Find "Daily Curator" workflow:**
   - Click on it in the left sidebar

3. **Run manually:**
   - Click **"Run workflow"** button (right side)
   - Select **"Branch: main"**
   - Click **"Run workflow"**

4. **Watch it run:**
   - Click on the running workflow
   - Click on the **"curate"** job
   - Expand **"Post to Mastodon"** step

5. **Check results:**
   - ✅ Success: You'll see "Mastodon status posted: [URL]"
   - ✅ If curator found no content: "Missing MASTO_INSTANCE or MASTO_TOKEN. Skipping." (this is OK, means no post was created)
   - ❌ Error: Check that your token is correct

6. **Verify on Mastodon:**
   - Go to your Mastodon profile: https://mastodon.social/@YourUsername
   - You should see the new post!

## 🎯 What Happens Now

**Every day at 1pm Toronto time:**
1. ✅ Curator scans 60+ RSS feeds
2. ✅ Scores content with intelligent algorithm
3. ✅ If good content found (score ≥2.5):
   - Creates blog post on your site
   - **Automatically posts to Mastodon** 🐘
4. ✅ If no good content: Nothing happens (no spam!)

---

## 🛠️ Customization Options

Want to change the post message? Edit `scripts/post-mastodon.js`:

```javascript
// Current default:
let status = process.env.MASTO_STATUS || `Daily highlights for ${date} are live: ${siteUrl}\n\n#Accessibility #A11y #Disability #Canada`;
```

**Ideas:**
- Add more hashtags
- Change the message text
- Include specific topics
- Tag other accounts (use @username)

**To customize:**
1. Edit `scripts/post-mastodon.js`
2. Change the `status` variable
3. Commit and push
4. Done! Next post uses new format

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

**Your token is safe because:**
- ✅ Stored in GitHub Secrets (encrypted)
- ✅ Only accessible to your workflows
- ✅ Not visible in logs
- ✅ Limited to `write:statuses` only (can't read DMs, can't delete, can't admin)

**If compromised:**
1. Go to https://mastodon.social/settings/applications
2. Click on "3mpowr Daily Curator"
3. Click **"Revoke access"**
4. Create new token (repeat Step 1-3)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Missing MASTO_INSTANCE or MASTO_TOKEN. Skipping."
- ✅ This is OK! It means curator didn't find content worth posting
- Check `_curation/` folder to see what was scanned

### "Mastodon post failed: 401 Unauthorized"
- ❌ Token is incorrect or revoked
- Solution: Generate new token, update GitHub secret

### "Mastodon post failed: 422 Unprocessable Entity"
- ❌ Post format issue (too long, invalid characters)
- Solution: Check `scripts/post-mastodon.js` for errors

### "Error posting to Mastodon: fetch failed"
- ❌ Network issue or Mastodon server down
- Solution: Check https://status.mastodon.social/ - usually temporary

### Posts not appearing
- Check workflow didn't run (time gate check)
- Check curator found no content (check artifacts)
- Check Mastodon profile visibility settings

---

## 📊 What Gets Posted

**The script posts ONLY when:**
1. ✅ Curator runs at 1pm Toronto time
2. ✅ Curator finds content scoring ≥2.5 points
3. ✅ A blog post is created
4. ✅ Both secrets are configured

**It does NOT post:**
- ❌ Empty results
- ❌ Low-quality content
- ❌ Multiple times per day
- ❌ When time gate fails

**Estimated frequency:** 60-70% of days (4-5 times per week)

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when:**
- Workflow shows "Mastodon status posted: [URL]"
- Post appears on your Mastodon timeline
- Post includes correct date and URL
- Hashtags are clickable
- Post is public (unless you change visibility)

**Check workflow results:**
- Go to Actions → Daily Curator → Latest run
- Expand "Post to Mastodon" step
- Look for success message with post URL

## 🎉 All Done!

Your automated social media pipeline is now active! Every day your curator:
1. 🔍 Finds relevant disability rights content
2. 📝 Creates a blog post on your site
3. 🐘 Shares it on Mastodon automatically

**No cost. No maintenance. Just growth!** 🚀

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Engage with responses:** Even though posting is automated, reply to comments personally!

2. **Pin an intro post:** Create a pinned post explaining what 3mpowr does and link to your site

3. **Use alt text:** If you later add images, always include alt text for accessibility

4. **Cross-post strategically:** Use same message on other platforms manually (Twitter, LinkedIn)

5. **Monitor hashtags:** Search #Disability #Accessibility on Mastodon to find community members

6. **Follow relevant accounts:** Government agencies, advocacy orgs, disability activists
