## 🔄 How Real-Time Sync Works

### For Campaigns:

1. **User Creates Campaign in App:**
   - User opens 3mpwrApp
   - Creates a campaign with all details
   - Marks it as "Public"
   - Saves to Firestore database

2. **Cloudflare Worker Serves Data:**
   - Campaign is stored in Firestore
   - Cloudflare Worker API reads from Firestore
   - API endpoint serves JSON: `https://empowrapp-campaigns.empowrapp08162025.workers.dev/api/campaigns`

3. **Website Displays Campaign:**
   - Website fetches from API every 5 minutes
   - JavaScript renders campaign cards dynamically
   - Users see campaign within 5 minutes of creation

### For Events:

1. **User Creates Event in App:**
   - User opens 3mpwrApp
   - Creates an event with accessibility details
   - Marks it as "Public"
   - Saves to Firestore (`events_production` collection)

2. **Cloudflare Worker Serves Data:**
   - Event is stored in Firestore
   - Cloudflare Worker API reads from Firestore
   - API endpoint serves JSON: `https://3mpwrapp-calendar.empowrapp08162025.workers.dev/api/events?env=production`
   - Also generates ICS calendar feed: `https://3mpwrapp-calendar.empowrapp08162025.workers.dev/events.ics?env=production`

3. **Website Displays Event:**
   - Website fetches from API every 5 minutes
   - JavaScript renders event cards dynamically
   - Users see event within 5 minutes of creation
   - Calendar subscribers get event within 1-24 hours (depending on calendar app refresh rate)

## ⏱️ Update Frequencies

| Component | Update Frequency | Details |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Campaigns Website** | Every 5 minutes | Auto-refresh via `setInterval` |
| **Events Website** | Every 5 minutes | Auto-refresh via `setInterval` |
| **Events ICS Feed** | Hourly | Cached via Cloudflare KV for performance |
| **User Calendar Apps** | 1-24 hours | Depends on calendar app (Google Calendar = up to 24hrs) |

1. **Open in Browser:**
   ```
   https://3mpwrapp.ca/events/
   ```

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Page loads with "Loading events..." message briefly

   ```
   https://3mpwrapp-calendar.empowrapp08162025.workers.dev/api/events?env=production
   ```
   Should return JSON with `events` array

4. **Test ICS Calendar Feed:**
   ```
   https://3mpwrapp-calendar.empowrapp08162025.workers.dev/events.ics?env=production
   ```
   Should return iCalendar format (.ics) data
