## üöÄ How It Works Daily

### Automated Process (1pm Toronto Time)

1. **Feed Crawling** (2-3 minutes)
   - Fetches 60+ RSS feeds
   - Searches Mastodon for disability content
   - Collects ~300-500 candidate items

2. **Scoring & Filtering** (< 1 minute)
   - Scores each item using enhanced algorithm
   - Filters out spam and low-quality content
   - Removes duplicates (keeps highest score)
   - Applies per-source caps (max 3 per domain)

3. **Priority Ranking**
   - Ensures at least 1 item from must-include sources (if present)
   - Sorts by score (highest first)
   - Keeps top 25 items

4. **Quality Check**
   - If items meet threshold (2.5+ points): **Create post** ‚úÖ
   - If no items meet threshold: **Skip post** ‚ùå

5. **Publishing** (if post created)
   - Creates markdown file: `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-daily-curation.md`
   - Commits to GitHub
   - Site auto-rebuilds
   - Posts to Mastodon (if configured)

6. **Human Review**
   - Creates summary in `_curation/` folder
   - Shows all scored items for your review
   - You can manually edit/remove items before they go live

```

### Change Item Limit

"maxItems": 30  // Instead of 25 (show more items)
"maxItems": 15  // Instead of 25 (show fewer, highest quality)
```

### Per-Source Diversity
```json
"perSourceCap": 5  // Allow up to 5 items from same source
"perSourceCap": 2  // Only 2 items max per source (more diversity)
```

### Add Must-Include Sources

Edit `mustIncludeHosts` to ensure certain sources always appear (if they have content):
```json
"mustIncludeHosts": [
  "accessible.canada.ca",
  "www.canada.ca",
