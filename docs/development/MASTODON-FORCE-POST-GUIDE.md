## Troubleshooting

### "Workflow run doesn't show up"

**Solution:**
- Wait 10-15 seconds and refresh GitHub Actions page
- Check you're on the "main" branch
- Verify you have permissions to trigger workflows

### "Mastodon credentials rejected"

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/3mpowrApp/3mpwrapp.github.io/settings/secrets/actions
2. Update these secrets:
   - `MASTO_INSTANCE` - Should be: `https://mastodon.social`
   - `MASTO_TOKEN` - Your new access token from Mastodon
3. Test by running workflow again

### "Posts appear, then get deleted"

**Possible causes:**
- Content violates Mastodon server rules (check content)
- Token has limited visibility permissions
- Auto-moderation flagged the post

**Solution:**
- Check Mastodon moderation log
- Verify token has these permissions:
  - ‚úÖ `write:statuses` (post statuses)
  - ‚úÖ `read:accounts` (verify credentials)

### "Want to change what gets posted?"

**Edit these files:**

1. **News post content:**
   - File: `scripts/post-to-mastodon.js`
   - Lines: 120-140 (formatting function)

2. **Promotion message:**
   - File: `scripts/post-to-mastodon.js`
   - Lines: 142-160 (promotion array)

3. **Curation script:**
   - File: `scripts/daily-curator.js`
   - Adjust scoring and content selection
