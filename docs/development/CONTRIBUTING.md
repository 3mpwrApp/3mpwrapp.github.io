### Making Changes

Introduction paragraph.

## Subheader

- List item one
- List item two

[Link text](path/to/page)

![Alt text for image](path/to/image.png)
```

### HTML in Markdown

- Use HTML sparingly, only when Markdown isn't sufficient
- Keep HTML semantic and accessible
- Include ARIA labels when needed

### File Organization

- Place images in `/assets/images/`
- Place styles in `/assets/css/`

### Content Style

- Write in clear, concise language

- Check spelling and grammar
