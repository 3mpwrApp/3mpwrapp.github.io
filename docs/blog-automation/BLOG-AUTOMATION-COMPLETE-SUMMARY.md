## 🔍 What Was Wrong?

### Content Generation
✅ **Actually working!** All 4 content types were already generating:
- Daily Curated News ✅
- Daily Feature Spotlights ✅
- Weekly Updates ✅
- Community Blog Posts ✅

### Social Media Posting
❌ **Had problems:**
- Wrong or broken links in posts
- Links didn't consistently point to blog sections

---

## ✨ What We Fixed

### 1. Standardized All Blog Links ✅

**Before:**
- Some posts linked to `https://3mpwrapp.ca/`
- Inconsistent URL construction across scripts
- Links sometimes broken or 404

**After:**
- All posts link to `https://3mpwrapp.ca/blog/#curated-daily`
- Consistent use of `site-config.js` for URLs
- Feature articles link directly to article pages

**Files Updated:**
- `scripts/social-post.js`
- `scripts/post-daily-feature.js`
- `scripts/post-to-mastodon.js`
- `scripts/post-to-bluesky.js`
- `scripts/daily-feature-generator.js`

### 2. User-Friendly Section Names ✅

**Before:**
- "Daily Curated Highlights" (too formal)
- "Feature Articles" (generic)
- "Weekly Recaps" (okay but could be clearer)
- "Community Blog Posts" (wordy)

**After:**
- "📰 Daily News Highlights" (clear, friendly)
- "✨ Feature Spotlights" (exciting, inviting)
- "📅 Weekly Recaps" (kept, works well)
- "💬 Community Updates" (concise, welcoming)

**Files Updated:**
