title: Easier to find your way around â€“ Better site navigation and design
date: 2025-09-28
description: We cleaned up our website to make it easier to navigate, find what you need, and use on any device.

We worked on making the website easier to use for everyone.

- Removed duplicate pages so there's only one way to find what you need
- Made the menu clearer and easier to follow
- Made text darker and buttons easier to see if you use a keyboard

Why it matters: a clearer website means you can find answers faster, and better design helps people with different needs use the site.
