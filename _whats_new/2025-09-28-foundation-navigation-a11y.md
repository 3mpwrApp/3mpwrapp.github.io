title: Site foundation, cleaner navigation, and better basics

description: We tidied up the site structure, fixed duplicate pages, made navigation clearer, and improved contrast and focus for accessibility.

We focused on the fundamentals so the site is easier to understand and navigate.

- Consolidated duplicates (like Privacy and 404) and ensured a single, clear homepage
- Cleaned up the top navigation and made the brand logo link home
- Improved color contrast and visible focus styles for keyboard users

Why it matters: a simpler structure helps everyone find content quickly, and better contrast/focus makes the site more accessible.
