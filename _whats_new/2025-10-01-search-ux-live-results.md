description: Search now shows on‑page results with term highlighting and screen‑reader announcements, with DuckDuckGo fallback if you need a wider search.

What’s new:

- On‑page live results with ranking by title > URL > content
- Highlighted search terms and polite announcements of result counts
- DuckDuckGo fallback scoped to 3mpowr if you want a broader search

Why it matters: find what you need faster, with accessible feedback as results update.
