title: More languages, accessibility tools, and better tracking
date: 2025-10-05
description: We added Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and Punjabi so more people can use the site. We made accessibility settings easier to find, and set up tracking that respects your privacy.

What's new today:

- New language pages: Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and Punjabi
- Arabic pages now read right-to-left (the correct way)
- Accessibility Settings moved to the main menu (easier to find)
- Tracking set up to respect your privacy choices

Why it matters: more people can access our content in their language, and your privacy is protected.
