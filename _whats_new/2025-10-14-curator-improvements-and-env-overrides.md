title: Better Daily Content Selection â€“ More Reliable Updates
date: 2025-10-14 13:05:00 +0000
summary: We improved how we automatically pick content each day to make the process more reliable and to ensure fresh content every day.

What we improved:

- Daily content selection is now more reliable and consistent
- We always have fresh content available, even if there are fewer items some days
- We can test and adjust how content is selected to make sure it's most relevant to you

Why it matters: you get consistent, fresh updates every day without gaps, and we can improve the selection over time based on what's most helpful.
