title: Better newsletter sign-up and easier keyboard navigation

description: We made it easier to sign up for our newsletter, and added tools to help keyboard users navigate the page faster.

What's better now:

- Newsletter sign-up: press Escape to close, or click outside to close
- First-time visitors see a sign-up offer, but can choose not to see it again
- Added "Skip to" links to jump to main content, menu, or footer without scrolling through everything

Why it matters: signing up is faster and easier, and keyboard users can jump straight to what they need.
