title: Accessible newsletter modal, focus improvements, and new skip links
date: 2025-09-29
description: We added an accessible newsletter sign‑up, improved keyboard focus, and introduced skip links to move around the page faster.

What changed:

- Accessible newsletter modal: close with Escape, click outside, or buttons; focus stays inside while open
- First‑visit gating with a “Don’t show again” option; CI flag available to disable during checks
- Added Skip to content/navigation/footer links and enhanced focus‑visible styles

Why it matters: signing up is smoother and more accessible; skip links save time for keyboard and screen reader users.
