title: New "What's New" section and better quality checks
date: 2025-10-04

What we launched:

- A "What's New" page that shows recent updates and keeps a 30-day history
- Better automatic checks to catch accessibility issues before they go live
- Quick status checks so you can see how the website is doing

Why it matters: you can easily see what's new, and we catch problems early so the site stays accessible for everyone.
