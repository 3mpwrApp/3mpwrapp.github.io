We added a new What's New section to announce updates and improvements:

- What's New landing page with recent updates and a 30-day archive.
- Accessibility CI hardened: Pa11y and Axe summaries and artifacts.
- CI non-blocking on pushes to main; manual triggers for Links and Lighthouse.
- README badges for quick status visibility.
