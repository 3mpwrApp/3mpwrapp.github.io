What’s new today:

- Curated Daily Highlights now has a clear banner on the homepage so it’s easy to find.
- We expanded the daily curation sources with more provincial workers’ compensation boards and disability advocacy groups.
- We improved how we find relevant items by including UN CRPD and Accessible Canada Act terms.
- We fixed a breadcrumb issue that could create an empty link, improving accessibility.

Why it matters: daily community stories are easier to spot, the feed stays Canada‑wide and relevant, and the site remains accessible for everyone.
