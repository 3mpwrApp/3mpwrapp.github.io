description: We set up automated checks for accessibility, broken links, and Lighthouse audits to keep quality high as we grow.

Whatâ€™s running now:

- Accessibility checks with Pa11y/axe-core (keyboard, labels, contrast, and more)
- Broken link scanning
- Lighthouse audits (performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO)

Why it matters: these run on pull requests and schedules, catching issues early and keeping the site healthy.
