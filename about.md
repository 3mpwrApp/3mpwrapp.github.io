### 💚 Grassroots & Community-Funded

**3mpwrApp is 100% free and always will be.** We're a grassroots, community-focused initiative with a mission-driven approach focused on empowerment, not profit. No paid tiers. No subscriptions. No in-app purchases. Ever.

We're built BY the disability community, FOR the disability community, funded through community support and driven by our shared values of accessibility, dignity, and collective power.

**Our funding model:**
- 💚 Community donations (optional, never required)
- 🤝 Grants focused on disability rights and accessibility
- 🎯 Mission-aligned partnerships that respect our values

### 🇨🇦 Currently Serving Canada-Wide

**3mpwrApp is built for the Canadian disability rights community** - supporting persons with disabilities, injured workers, supporters, allies, and unions across all provinces and territories. We understand Canadian systems (WSIB, WCB, provincial disability programs), Indigenous sovereignty and OCAP principles, and the unique challenges faced by disabled and injured workers navigating Canadian legal and healthcare systems.

**Our approach:** Perfect our platform for Canada first, building the strongest disability rights tool in the nation. Once we've proven our model works and serves our community effectively, we'll expand globally to support disability rights movements worldwide.

**What's next?** Check out our **[Roadmap](/roadmap/)** to see our vision for global expansion (2026-2028), including plans to serve 100+ countries and connect disability rights movements internationally.
