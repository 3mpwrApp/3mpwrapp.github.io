- Some RSS feeds were timing out or returning 404 errors

### **What Was Fixed:**

✅ Verified all remaining 9 feeds are working  
✅ Tested full parsing pipeline  
✅ Confirmed blog posts generate with proper content

## 🔧 **CODE CHANGES MADE**

### **1. Enhanced RSS Parser (`scripts/daily-curator.js`)**

**New Function:** `decodeHtmlEntities()`
- Decodes HTML entities: `&#8217;` → `'`, `&#038;` → `&`, etc.
- Decodes numeric character references: `&#123;` format
- Decodes hex character references: `&#x7B;` format

**Improved Parser:**
- Extracts from CDATA sections: `<![CDATA[...]]>`
- Handles XML namespaces: `dc:`, `content:`, etc.
- Properly parses both RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 formats
- Only includes items with valid title OR link (prevents empty items)

**Before vs After:**
```
BEFORE: 
  - [Post]() — (empty titles/links)
  - No descriptions

AFTER:
  - [DTC Medical Fees Fund: ...](https://disabilityalliancebc.org/...)
  - Full descriptions included
```

### **2. Updated Curator Configuration (`_data/curator.json`)**

**Removed:**
- ❌ `https://www.ctvnews.ca/rss/canada` (HTTP 301 redirect issues)
- ❌ Google Reader feeds (deprecated, timeouts)

**Kept (9 working feeds):**
- ✅ Disability Alliance BC
- ✅ Manitoba, Northwest Territories government news
- ✅ Global News, Rabble, The Straight, The Tyee
- ✅ Policy Options, CBC Canada

**Impact:** 100% feed success rate (9/9 feeds working)

## 🚀 **HOW BLOG POSTS ARE GENERATED**

### **Automated Daily Generation:**

```
STEP 1: GitHub Actions Trigger
└─ Scheduled: 9:00 AM UTC daily (weekdays)
└─ Manual: Anytime via workflow_dispatch

STEP 2: Run daily-curator.js
└─ Fetch all 9 RSS feeds
└─ Parse 100+ items daily
└─ Score items by relevance (1.5–18.5 scale)
└─ Deduplicate using link matching

STEP 3: Select Top 25 Items
└─ Filter by minimum score (1.5)
└─ Cap items per source (4 max)
└─ Prioritize government sources

STEP 4: Generate Files
├─ _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-daily-curation.md (blog post)
├─ _curation/YYYY-MM-DD-curation.md (detailed summary)
└─ public/curation-latest.json (API output)

STEP 5: Git Commit & Push
└─ Commit message: "📰 Daily curation - YYYY-MM-DD"
└─ Push to GitHub main branch
└─ Deployed to live site via Cloudflare Pages
```

### **Manual Testing:**

```bash
# Test with debug output
DEBUG_CURATOR=1 node scripts/daily-curator.js

# Test with custom minimum score
MIN_SCORE=0.5 node scripts/daily-curator.js

# Generate JSON API output
WRITE_JSON=1 node scripts/daily-curator.js

# Force publish (even low-score items)
FORCE_PUBLISH=1 node scripts/daily-curator.js

# Combined test
MIN_SCORE=0.5 DEBUG_CURATOR=1 WRITE_JSON=1 node scripts/daily-curator.js
```

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING REFERENCE**

### **If posts aren't appearing:**

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs:**
   - Go to `.github/workflows/daily-curation.yml`
   - View recent runs
   - Check for error messages

2. **Run manually:**
   ```bash
   DEBUG_CURATOR=1 node scripts/daily-curator.js
   ```

3. **Verify files created:**
   - `_posts/` - blog post file
   - `_curation/` - detailed summary
   - `public/curation-latest.json` - API output

4. **Check Jekyll build:**
   - `jekyll build` to regenerate site
   - Check `_site/blog/index.html` for posts

### **If feeds aren't being parsed:**

1. Test a single feed:
   ```bash
   curl https://disabilityalliancebc.org/feed/
   ```

2. Check curator.json is valid JSON:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('_data/curator.json','utf8')))"
   ```

3. Enable debug mode:
   ```bash
   DEBUG_CURATOR=1 node scripts/daily-curator.js 2>&1 | grep "Feed:"
   ```
