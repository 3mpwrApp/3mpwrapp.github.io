# Social Media API Testing - Quick Verification

## ‚úÖ What We Have

### X (Twitter)
- ‚úÖ Bearer Token in GitHub Secrets: `X_BEARER_TOKEN`
- ‚úÖ API Key in GitHub Secrets: `X_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ API Secret in GitHub Secrets: `X_API_SECRET`
- ‚úÖ Access Token in GitHub Secrets: `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- ‚úÖ Access Token Secret in GitHub Secrets: `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`

**Status:** Credentials stored, but test showed 403 error (permission issue)

### Mastodon
- ‚úÖ Instance in GitHub Secrets: `MASTO_INSTANCE` (should be: mastodon.social)
- ‚úÖ Token in GitHub Secrets: `MASTO_TOKEN`
- ‚úÖ Account created: @3mpwrApp at https://mastodon.social/@3mpwrApp

**Status:** Ready to post

## üêõ Issues Found

### X API - 403 Permission Denied
**Possible causes:**
1. Bearer Token missing or incorrect
2. App doesn't have "Read and Write" permissions
3. Bearer Token is for a different API version
4. App needs to be recreated

**Fix:**
1. Go to: https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard
2. Select your app (3mpwr App)
3. Check "App permissions" - should be "Read and Write"
4. Go to "Keys and tokens"
5. Regenerate or verify Bearer Token
6. Update GitHub Secret `X_BEARER_TOKEN`

### Mastodon - Invalid Instance
**What happened:**
- Special characters were entered instead of instance name
- Should be: `mastodon.social`

**Status:** This is just the test input - actual GitHub Secret should be correct

## ‚ú® How to Verify Without Manual Test

Since the test script had issues with input, here's how to verify:

### Option 1: Check GitHub Actions Logs
1. Go to: https://github.com/3mpwrApp/3mpwrapp.github.io/actions
2. Find "Daily Curation" workflow
3. Click on the latest run
4. Check "Post to social media" step
5. Look for success/error messages

### Option 2: Manual Verification
1. **X:** Check your @3mpwrApp X account - any new posts in last 24 hours?
2. **Mastodon:** Check @3mpwrApp@mastodon.social - any new posts?

### Option 3: Next Scheduled Run
1. Automation runs at **9 AM UTC** daily
2. After 9 AM UTC, check both accounts for new posts
3. Posts will appear if credentials are valid

## üìã What We Know Works

‚úÖ **Mastodon is definitely set up:**
- Account exists: https://mastodon.social/@3mpwrApp
- Secrets are in GitHub
- Profile is active

‚úÖ **X is probably set up:**
- Bearer Token is stored
- All 5 secrets are in GitHub
- Test showed 403 (permission issue, not credential issue)

## üéØ Next Steps

### Option A: Fix X Permissions
1. Go to X Developer Portal
2. Verify app has "Read and Write" permissions
3. Regenerate Bearer Token if needed
4. Update GitHub Secret
5. Test again

### Option B: Wait for Next Automation Run
1. At 9 AM UTC tomorrow, GitHub Actions will try to post
2. Check logs to see what works
3. Adjust credentials if needed

### Option C: Both!
1. Fix X permissions now
2. Wait for 9 AM UTC tomorrow for full test
3. Verify both platforms posting
