Creator here. I started this after my partner was injured at work and 
we spent months fighting with insurance, filling out forms, and 
navigating bureaucracy with zero help.

The system is broken. Workers' comp is adversarial. Disability 
paperwork is Byzantine. Legal help costs thousands.

So we built 3mpowr:
- Free forever, no ads, no tracking
- Master letter generator for appeals
- WCAG 2.2 AAA accessibility (screen reader tested)
- Support for Indigenous languages

It's been used by [X] people. We've helped with $[Y] in approved claims.

Would love your feedback, especially on accessibility and security.
