## 💡 How We Decide What to Build

**We listen to you!** Here's how we prioritize:

1. **Safety First** - Features that protect vulnerable users
2. **Accessibility Gaps** - Barriers that exclude people
3. **Canadian Priority** - Build and perfect features for Canada first, then adapt globally
4. **Most Requested** - What the community asks for most
5. **Cultural Respect** - Indigenous protocols and sovereignty
6. **Legal Impact** - Tools that help you win your case
7. **Movement Building** - Features that advance collective disability rights
8. **Union & Worker Power** - Tools that strengthen organized labor
9. **Community Input** - Advisory groups guide decisions
10. **Global Readiness** - Design for future international expansion

**Our Philosophy:**
- 🇨🇦 **Perfect it in Canada** - Get it right for Canadian disability rights community
- 🌍 **Then go global** - Adapt proven features to international contexts
- 🤝 **Community-led** - Disabled people design for disabled people
- ⚖️ **Justice-oriented** - Every feature should shift power toward users
- 🔓 **Open & Transparent** - Our roadmap is public, our code will be too (future)

## � Building a Movement, Not Just an App

**3mpwrApp isn't just technology - it's a tool for collective liberation.**

### Our Vision for Disability Rights

Traditional disability apps treat advocacy as an **individual problem**. 3mpwrApp recognizes it as a **systemic justice issue** that requires **collective action**.

**What makes us different:**

- **Power Analysis** - We know employers and insurers have structural advantages. Our features are designed to shift power back to workers and disabled people.
- **Collective Action** - Individual cases become data. Data becomes evidence. Evidence becomes policy change.
- **Solidarity Focus** - Connect disabled workers with unions, allies, and each other. Isolation is a tactic of oppression.
- **Justice Framework** - We center the most marginalized: BIPOC disabled folks, 2SLGBTQIA+ community, Indigenous peoples, low-income workers.
- **Abolitionist Approach** - Question why disabled people must constantly prove their worth. Advocate for systemic change, not just individual accommodations.

### Why This Matters

**Disabled people and injured workers face:**
- Adversarial systems designed to deny claims
- Employers who view accommodation as burden
- Medical "experts" who dismiss lived experience
- Legal processes that re-traumatize
- Isolation from others in similar situations
- Lack of resources to fight well-funded institutions

**3mpwrApp fights back by:**
- Aggregating individual struggles into collective power
- Exposing patterns of discrimination through data
- Connecting people to build solidarity
- Democratizing legal knowledge and winning strategies
- Providing tools to organize and mobilize
- Amplifying voices for legislative change
- Building economic alternatives through mutual aid

### The Long Game

**2025-2026:** Build the strongest disability rights platform in Canada  
**2027-2028:** Expand globally, connecting movements worldwide  
**2029-2030:** 50 million users. Undeniable political force. Real power.

**Ultimate Goal:** Make ourselves obsolete by winning the fights that make our app unnecessary - universal basic income, guaranteed housing, free healthcare, accessible everything, disability justice.

Until then, we build tools for the revolution. 🔥
