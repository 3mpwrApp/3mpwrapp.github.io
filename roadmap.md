## � Building a Movement, Not Just an App

**3mpwrApp isn't just technology - it's a tool for collective liberation.**

### Our Vision for Disability Rights

Traditional disability apps treat advocacy as an **individual problem**. 3mpwrApp recognizes it as a **systemic justice issue** that requires **collective action**.

**What makes us different:**

- **Power Analysis** - We know employers and insurers have structural advantages. Our features are designed to shift power back to workers and disabled people.
- **Collective Action** - Individual cases become data. Data becomes evidence. Evidence becomes policy change.
- **Solidarity Focus** - Connect disabled workers with unions, allies, and each other. Isolation is a tactic of oppression.
- **Justice Framework** - We center the most marginalized: BIPOC disabled folks, 2SLGBTQIA+ community, Indigenous peoples, low-income workers.
- **Abolitionist Approach** - Question why disabled people must constantly prove their worth. Advocate for systemic change, not just individual accommodations.

### Why This Matters

**Disabled people and injured workers face:**
- Adversarial systems designed to deny claims
- Employers who view accommodation as burden
- Medical "experts" who dismiss lived experience
- Legal processes that re-traumatize
- Isolation from others in similar situations
- Lack of resources to fight well-funded institutions

**3mpwrApp fights back by:**
- Aggregating individual struggles into collective power
- Exposing patterns of discrimination through data
- Connecting people to build solidarity
- Democratizing legal knowledge and winning strategies
- Providing tools to organize and mobilize
- Amplifying voices for legislative change
- Building economic alternatives through mutual aid

### The Long Game

**2025-2026:** Build the strongest disability rights platform in Canada  
**2027-2028:** Expand globally, connecting movements worldwide  
**2029-2030:** 50 million users. Undeniable political force. Real power.

**Ultimate Goal:** Make ourselves obsolete by winning the fights that make our app unnecessary - universal basic income, guaranteed housing, free healthcare, accessible everything, disability justice.

Until then, we build tools for the revolution. 🔥
