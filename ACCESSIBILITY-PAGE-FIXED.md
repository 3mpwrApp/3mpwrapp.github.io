## 🔍 Investigation

### Problem Discovery

The `accessibility.md` file was **completely corrupted** with:

1. **Broken YAML Front Matter**:
   ```markdown
   ------
   layout: defaultlayout: default
   title: Accessibility Statementtitle: Accessibility Statement
   permalink: /accessibility/---
   ```

2. **Duplicated Content**: Every single line was duplicated
   ```markdown
   # Accessibility Statement
   # Accessibility Statement
   
   3mpwrApp is committed...
   3mpwrApp is committed...
   ```

3. **Malformed Structure**: 371 lines of garbled text

### Root Cause

- File corruption in git history (possibly from merge conflict)
