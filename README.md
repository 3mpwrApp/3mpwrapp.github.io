# Empowr App

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

You can start developing by editing the files inside the `app` directory. This project uses file-based routing via Expo Router.

## Auth, Onboarding, and Guest Mode

- Auth store: `store/auth.tsx` manages auth state with optional AsyncStorage persistence.
- Onboarding: `app/(auth)/onboarding.tsx` shows an intro and a “Get Started” action.
- Login: `app/(auth)/login.tsx` provides a demo sign-in (name-only) or “Continue as Guest”.
- Routing: `app/index.tsx` redirects to onboarding, login, or the main tabs based on auth status.
- Header actions: The top header shows a login icon when signed out/guest, and a logout icon when signed in.

### States

- `needsOnboarding` → routes to `/(auth)/onboarding`
- `signedOut` → routes to `/(auth)/login`
- `anonymous` or `signedIn` → routes to `/(tabs)`

Notes
- AsyncStorage is optional. If not installed, auth state persists for the current session only.
