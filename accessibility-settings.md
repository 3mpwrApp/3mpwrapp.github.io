# Accessibility Settings

Use these controls to customize your viewing experience. Your preferences are saved in your browser on this device.

## Display options

- High contrast mode: use the “High contrast” button in the site header. This increases color contrast and focus visibility.
- Dark mode: use the “Dark mode” button in the site header. This switches to a dark color scheme.

## Motion

This site respects your system’s “Reduce Motion” preference and avoids unnecessary animations automatically. If you need further adjustments, let us know.

## Keyboard navigation

- Use the “Skip to content” and “Skip to footer” links at the top of the page.
- Press “Tab” to move between links and controls; “Shift + Tab” moves backwards.
- The newsletter modal can be closed with the “Escape” key, by clicking outside the dialog, or using the “Close”/“Not now” buttons. Focus is kept within the dialog while it is open.

## Reset preferences

If you want to reset your saved preferences, you can clear your browser’s site data for this domain. This clears the saved values used by the header toggles.

## Feedback
