- ❌ 6 basic subject options

#### After:
- ✅ **Beautiful gradient welcome box** explicitly listing 9 audience types:
  - 🦽 Persons with disabilities

  - 💙 Family supporters and caregivers
  - 🤝 Allies and advocates

### 3. 🤝 **Connect Page (connect/index.md)** - MAJORLY ENHANCED

#### Before:
- ⚠️ Listed organization types but not individual audiences
- ⚠️ Vague "We're interested in hearing from..."
- ⚠️ Didn't explicitly welcome non-disabled allies, family supporters, general public

#### After:
- ✅ **9 dedicated sections**, one for each audience type
- ✅ Each section includes:
  - Who they are
  - Why they should connect
  - Specific ways to get involved
  - Direct email links with pre-filled subjects
  - Examples of contributions they can make

**New Sections:**
1. **🦽 Persons with Disabilities & Injured Workers** - "You are the heart of 3mpwrApp"
2. **💙 Family Supporters & Caregivers** - "Your perspective matters"
3. **🛠️ Unions & Labour Organizations** - "Let's fight together"
4. **🤝 Non-Disabled Allies & Advocates** - "Solidarity is action"
5. **🏥 Healthcare Providers** - "Bridge the gap between medicine and advocacy"
6. **⚖️ Legal Advocates** - "Justice for all"
7. **🏢 Progressive Employers** - "Real accessibility, not performative"
8. **🌍 General Public** - "Curious about disability justice? Welcome!"
9. **📰 Media & Researchers** - "Tell our stories accurately"

**Impact:** No one has to wonder "Is this for me?" - they can find themselves explicitly welcomed with actionable next steps.

---

### 4. 📣 **Campaigns Page (campaigns/index.md)** - SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED

#### Before:
- ⚠️ Mentioned disabled people and injured workers
- ❌ Didn't explicitly invite allies, supporters, unions, healthcare providers to organize
- ❌ Campaign ideas not segmented by organizer type

#### After:
- ✅ **Powerful gradient intro box** titled "Power to the People: ALL People"
  - Lists all 8 organizer types
  - Bold statement: "You don't need to be disabled to fight for disability justice. You don't need to be injured to support injured workers. ALL are welcome to organize!"

- ✅ **NEW SECTION: "Campaign Ideas By Organizer Type"**
  - 9 subsections, each tailored to specific organizers
  - Shows what campaigns THEY can create based on THEIR expertise
  - Examples:
    - **Persons with Disabilities:** Accessible transportation based on YOUR daily barriers
    - **Injured Workers:** WSIB/WCB reform from YOUR system experience
    - **Family Supporters:** Caregiver support programs, respite funding
    - **Unions:** Disability inclusion in collective agreements
    - **Allies:** Amplify disabled-led campaigns (share, don't lead)
    - **Healthcare Providers:** Patient-centered care policy reforms
    - **Legal Advocates:** Accessible legal information campaigns
    - **Employers:** Workplace accessibility beyond minimum compliance
    - **General Public:** Ableism awareness campaigns

**Impact:** Every potential organizer can see exactly what campaigns they can lead based on their unique position and expertise. No more wondering "What can I do?"

## 🚀 What This Means For 3mpwrApp

❌ Non-disabled allies might feel excluded  
❌ Family supporters might not know they can participate

❌ General public might assume it's "only for disabled people"

### After These Changes:
✅ **Everyone** immediately sees themselves represented  
✅ **Every audience** knows they're welcome  
✅ **Specific actions** for each group's unique position  
✅ **No assumptions** about who can participate  
✅ **Explicit invitations** to organize, connect, contribute

- Other audiences support, amplify, collaborate
- Power dynamics acknowledged

### 4. **Actionable Invitations**

- "Here's exactly what you can do"
- Role-specific calls to action

### 5. **Visual Impact**
- Beautiful gradient boxes draw attention
