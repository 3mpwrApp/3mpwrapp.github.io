## 🎯 About Cloudflare Preview Deployments

### What You Saw
- **URL:** `https://7314eccf.3mpwrapp.pages.dev`
- **Type:** Preview deployment (temporary test version)
- **Why broken:** Built from corrupted commit

### What to Use
- **URL:** `https://3mpwrapp.pages.dev`
- **Type:** Production deployment
- **Status:** Will work once fixes are pushed

### How Cloudflare Works

**Every time you push to GitHub:**
1. Cloudflare detects the commit
2. Creates a **preview deployment** with random code (like `7314eccf`)
3. Builds and tests it
4. If main branch → also updates **production** (`3mpwrapp.pages.dev`)

**Preview deployments:**
- ❌ NOT meant for public use
- ❌ Often incomplete or broken during testing
- ✅ Useful for testing changes before going live
- 🗑️ Automatically deleted after 30 days
- 🔒 Can be disabled in settings if you don't need them

**Production deployment:**
- ✅ Your real, live website
- ✅ Always at `3mpwrapp.pages.dev`
- ✅ Only updates when main branch is pushed
- ✅ The only URL you should share publicly

---

## 🧹 Managing Deployments

### Option 1: Ignore Them (Recommended)
- Preview deployments auto-delete after 30 days
- Just always use `3mpwrapp.pages.dev`
- No action needed

### Option 2: Disable Preview Deployments
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Click **Workers & Pages** → **3mpwrapp**
3. Click **Settings**
4. Scroll to **Builds & deployments**
5. Under **Preview deployments**, select:
   - ⭕ **None** (disable all previews)
   - OR ⭕ **Custom branches** (only specific branches)
6. Save

**Pros:** Cleaner, less confusion  
**Cons:** Can't test changes before they go live

### Option 3: Delete Old Previews Manually
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Click **Workers & Pages** → **3mpwrapp**
3. Click **View all deployments**
4. For each preview (the ones with codes):
   - Click the ⋮ menu
   - Click **Delete deployment**

**Note:** Only do this if they're bothering you - they auto-delete anyway

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**For your use case (solo developer, direct to production):**

→ **Disable preview deployments entirely**

**Why:**
- You're pushing directly to main branch
- No team reviewing changes
- Previews just create confusion
- Every push goes live anyway

**How to disable:**
1. Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → 3mpwrapp
2. Settings → Builds & deployments
3. Preview deployments → Select "None"
4. Save

**Result:** 
- Only `3mpwrapp.pages.dev` exists
- No more random URLs like `7314eccf.3mpwrapp.pages.dev`
- Cleaner, simpler
