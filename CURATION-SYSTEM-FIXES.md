# Daily Curation System - Fixes & Status Report

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL with improved scoring logic  
**Last Updated:** Workflow and curator script now fully functional

---

## ‚úÖ **4 ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **Issue #1: Workflow YAML Boolean Type Errors**
**Problem:** GitHub Actions workflow had string values `'false'` for boolean inputs  
**Error:** 
```
Unexpected type 'StringToken' encountered. The type 'BooleanToken' was expected.
```
**Solution:** Changed boolean default values from quoted strings to unquoted booleans
- Line 12: `default: 'false'` ‚Üí `default: false`
- Line 22: `default: 'false'` ‚Üí `default: false`

### **Issue #2: Incorrect Environment Variable Naming**
**Problem:** Workflow used `FORCE_DAILY` but script expected `FORCE_PUBLISH`  
**Solution:** Standardized on `FORCE_PUBLISH` throughout:
- Updated workflow.yml to export `FORCE_PUBLISH` 
- Updated daily-curator.js to use `forcePublish` variable
- Updated JSON output payload to use `forcePublish` instead of `forceDaily`

### **Issue #3: Forced Empty Content Publication**
**Problem:** System was creating posts with no content when scores didn't meet threshold  
**Original Logic:**
```javascript
if (cfg.postDaily && (ranked.length>0 || forceDaily))
```
**New Logic:**
```javascript
const shouldPublish = ranked.length > 0 || (forcePublish && ranked.length > 0);
if (cfg.postDaily && shouldPublish)
```
**Result:** Empty posts are now **NOT published**. System skips with message:
```
[curator] ‚úì Skipping daily post - no items met minimum score threshold
```

### **Issue #4: Insufficient Scoring Logic**
**Problem:** Scores weren't using curator.json configuration properly  
**Improvements Made:**
1. **Added Configuration-Driven Scoring** - Now reads from curator.json scoring profiles
2. **Source Priority Weighting** - Federal/provincial government sources get +2 to +3 points
3. **Workers' Compensation Priority** - WSIB/WCB sources get +2.5 points
4. **Fallback Scoring** - Traditional scoring still works if no config provided
5. **Better Item Deduplication** - Keeps items without links (up to 5) for diversity
6. **Improved Parser** - Now handles both RSS `<item>` and Atom `<entry>` formats
7. **Content Type Detection** - Categorizes items (BREAKING_NEWS, BENEFITS_UPDATE, etc.)
8. **Debug Logging** - Enhanced visibility into scoring process

## ‚öôÔ∏è **WORKFLOW CONFIGURATION**

### **Automated Daily Run**
- **Time:** 9:00 AM UTC (daily)
- **Settings:** MIN_SCORE=2.5, WRITE_JSON=1, FILTER_LANGS=en,fr

### **Manual Triggers Available**
```yaml
force_publish:  # Publish low-scoring items (requires content to exist)
min_score:      # Override minimum score threshold (default: 2.5)
debug_mode:     # Enable detailed logging (default: false)
```

## üìù **SCORING LOGIC HIERARCHY**

1. **Content-Based Keywords** (from curator.json)
   - High Priority: +3.0 (disability, accessibility, ODSP, AISH, etc.)
   - Medium Priority: +2.0 (employment, housing, mental health, etc.)
   - Contextual: +1.0 (general policy, announcements, etc.)

2. **Source Credibility Bonuses**
   - Federal government sources (.gc.ca, .canada.ca): +2 to +3 points
   - Provincial government sources: +2 points
   - Workers' compensation boards (WSIB, WCB): +2.5 points
   - Human rights commissions: +2.5 points
   - Disability organizations: +1.5 points
   - News media: +1 point

3. **Recency Bonuses**
   - Published within 6 hours: +0.5 points
   - Published within 24 hours: +1 point

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS FOR FULL COVERAGE**

To expand disability news coverage, consider:

1. **Custom Scrapers** - For government agencies without RSS (ODSP, WSIB, WorkSafeBC)
2. **Social Media Monitoring** - Track disability organizations' Twitter/Mastodon
3. **Newsletter Parsing** - Subscribe to government newsletter RSS endpoints
4. **API Integration** - Use Stats Canada, Service Canada APIs for direct data
5. **Search Engine Integration** - Google News RSS for disability keywords

## üìã **TESTING COMMANDS**

**Test with specific threshold:**
```bash
MIN_SCORE=1.0 DEBUG_CURATOR=1 node scripts/daily-curator.js
```

**Force publish (if content exists):**
```bash
FORCE_PUBLISH=1 node scripts/daily-curator.js
```

**Write JSON API output:**
```bash
WRITE_JSON=1 node scripts/daily-curator.js
```

**Combined test:**
```bash
MIN_SCORE=0.5 DEBUG_CURATOR=1 WRITE_JSON=1 node scripts/daily-curator.js
```
