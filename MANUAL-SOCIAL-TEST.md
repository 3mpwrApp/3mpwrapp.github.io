   - Leave others as default
   - Click "Run workflow" (green button)

3. **Wait for Execution**
   - Workflow should take 2-3 minutes
   - You'll see workflow running in the list
   - Check logs by clicking on the workflow run

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Missing Mastodon Credentials"
**Problem:** MASTO_INSTANCE or MASTO_TOKEN not found  
**Solution:** 
1. Go to: https://github.com/3mpowrApp/3mpwrapp.github.io/settings/secrets/actions
2. Verify secrets exist and are spelled correctly
3. Re-enter if needed

### "HTTPS Error" or "Connection Refused"
**Problem:** Can't reach API endpoints  
**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify API endpoints are online
3. Try GitHub Actions run again in 5 minutes

### "Authentication Failed" or "401 Unauthorized"
**Problem:** Credentials are invalid or expired  
**Solution:**
1. For Mastodon: Regenerate access token on mastodon.social
2. For Bluesky: Verify password is current
3. For X: Check if tokens expired - regenerate if needed

### "No Items Met Minimum Score"
**Problem:** Daily curator found no articles worthy of posting  
**Solution:**
1. Use `force_publish: true` in GitHub Actions
2. Or lower `min_score` parameter (default: 2.5)
3. This is normal if few news items match criteria

### "Already Posted Today"
**Problem:** Workflow already ran and posted today  
**Solution:**
1. Use different parameters (force_publish, min_score)
2. Or wait until tomorrow (workflows run at 9 AM UTC daily)
3. This is expected behavior

## üí¨ Still Have Questions?

**Common Questions Answered:**

**Q: Why use GitHub Actions instead of running script locally?**  
A: GitHub Actions has the credentials in GitHub Secrets. Local environment doesn't have access to secrets for security.

**Q: Can I test individual platforms?**  
A: Yes - use the workflow parameters or modify the GitHub Actions workflow to run specific steps.

**Q: What if I see old posts from before today?**  
A: Normal - posts accumulate over time. Look for posts with today's date.

**Q: Can I manually post without GitHub Actions?**  
A: Only if you have the credentials. Ask the team for setup help.

**Q: When does it normally post?**  
A: Daily at 9:00 AM UTC automatically. Can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions.
