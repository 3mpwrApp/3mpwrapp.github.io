## 🎯 About Preview Deployments

### The Confusion
You saw: `https://7314eccf.3mpwrapp.pages.dev`

This was a **preview deployment** - a temporary test version that Cloudflare creates automatically. These are NOT meant for public use and are often broken.

### Your Real Site
**Always use:** `https://3mpwrapp.pages.dev`

This is your **production site** - the real, live version.

### 🎯 RECOMMENDED: Disable Preview Deployments

**Why disable them:**
- ✅ Prevents future confusion
- ✅ No more random URLs with codes
- ✅ Simpler, cleaner deployment
- ✅ You're working solo (don't need previews)

**How to disable:**
1. Log into Cloudflare Dashboard: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click **Workers & Pages** (left sidebar)
3. Click **3mpwrapp** project
4. Click **Settings** tab
5. Scroll to **Builds & deployments**
6. Under **Preview deployments**, select **"None"**
7. Click **Save**

**Result:** Only your production URL (`3mpwrapp.pages.dev`) will exist. No more confusion!
