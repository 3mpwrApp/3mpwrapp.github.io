## üîê 100% User Data Ownership Guarantee

**Your data belongs entirely to you.** 3mpwrApp is built on the fundamental principle of complete user data sovereignty:

- **üè† 100% User Ownership:** All data created in 3mpwrApp belongs entirely to you. We never own, claim, or retain your personal information.
- **üîí Local-First & Air-Gapped:** All processing happens on your device. Data stays in your possession unless you choose to sync to your own cloud.
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Your Cloud, Your Control:** Optional sync connects only to your chosen services (Google Drive, iCloud, WebDAV, Dropbox, OneDrive, AWS S3). No data passes through our servers.
- **üö´ Zero Tracking:** No embedded analytics, trackers, or third-party data collection without your explicit consent.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Military-Grade Security:** AES-256 encryption, hardware-backed key storage, TLS 1.3 network security, and anti-tampering protection.
- **üîç Verifiable Privacy:** Our codebase contains no hidden data-logging functions. You can inspect and verify our claims.

### Technical Implementation:
