# Accessibility Statement

3mpowr is committed to inclusive design. We aim to meet or exceed the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA, and we adopt selected AAA practices where feasible.

## Our approach
- Design with semantic HTML, proper landmarks, and descriptive headings
- Ensure keyboard access to all interactive elements
- Provide visible focus styles, skip links, and logical tab order
- Maintain sufficient color contrast and support dark and high‑contrast modes
- Respect user preferences, including reduced motion
- Make forms usable with clear labels, instructions, and error handling
- Offer captions and transcripts for audio/video when published

## Known limitations
- Embedded third‑party forms or media may have constraints beyond our control. We provide titles, labels, and alternatives where possible.
