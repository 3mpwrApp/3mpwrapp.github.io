# Accessibility Statement

3mpwrApp is committed to inclusive design. We aim to meet or exceed the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA, and we adopt selected AAA practices where feasible.

## Our Commitment

We believe accessibility isn't just complianceâ€”it's a core value. Our platform is designed to serve **persons with disabilities, injured workers, and everyone** navigating complex systems. We prioritize:

- âœ… **Universal Access** - Everyone should be able to use 3mpwrApp, regardless of ability
- âœ… **Continuous Improvement** - We regularly audit and enhance our accessibility features
- âœ… **User-Centered Design** - We listen to feedback from our community and implement changes
- âœ… **Transparency** - We document our progress and acknowledge areas for improvement

## Accessibility Goals

We strive to ensure 3mpwrApp is accessible to all users, including those with:

- âœ… **Visual impairments** - Screen reader support, high contrast modes, keyboard navigation
- âœ… **Cognitive disabilities** - Simplified modes, clear language, predictable navigation
- âœ… **Motor disabilities** - Keyboard-only navigation, large click targets, no time limits
- âœ… **Hearing impairments** - Captions on videos, visual alternatives for audio content

## Compliance Status

**Current Status**: WCAG 2.2 Level AA - Partial Conformance

We are actively working toward full conformance. "Partial conformance" means some parts of the content do not fully conform to WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

### What we've tested:
- âœ… Automated accessibility scanning (axe-core, pa11y, Lighthouse)
- âœ… Manual keyboard navigation testing
- âœ… Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- âœ… Color contrast analysis
- âœ… User testing with community members

---

## Known Limitations

We acknowledge current accessibility barriers and are actively working to address them:

- Some third-party embedded content may not meet our accessibility standards
- Certain dynamic features may require JavaScript (we provide fallbacks where possible)
- Not all PDF documents may be fully accessible (we're working on this)
- Some older blog posts may have accessibility issues (we're auditing and updating)

We welcome your feedback on any barriers you encounter.
